We also checked in with Dimitri Antoniou who is our VP of Strategic Initiatives and helped with the merger of the two companies. We asked them questions about the current campus, and also what the future may look like at Codeup’s new “Castle” campus.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Mike Jamie: Its history! Rackspace and former Rackers were instrumental in jumpstarting the tech industry here in San Antonio. This includes Geekdom, where Codeup was established. The Castle is where Rackspace ultimately decided to call its international headquarters.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Marcus Benavidez: The campus is designed with the student experience in mind. This includes the large classrooms and facilities to match. It’s a piece of San Antonio history as it’s on the Rackspace Campus.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Dimitri Antoniou: The Castle has been a staple of tech in San Antonio for years. Train new tech employees in high-growth careers like Cloud Administration from the Castle campus is an exciting extension of the legacy of Rackspace’s impact on San Antonio.',\n",

       "   'Mike: If you’re looking to get your foot in the door, I think it’s a no-brainer as you will be learning AWS administration, which is the most in-demand cloud computing platform. Also, the decision to focus on hands-on experience and know-how as opposed to certification exam memorization will better prepare students with practical knowledge.',\n",
       "   'Marcus: Do it. The time to positively impact your life and to create change is now.',\n",
       "   'Dimitri: Skills in networking, Linux, and AWS can put you on a path to so many different careers, including cybersecurity and cloud architecture. These are some of the highest growth and most exciting pathways in technology. With experienced experts like Jeremy Price and Kris Connolly to teach you, there’s no better way to open doors in IT.',\n",

       "   'Dimitri: AWS is one of 3 major cloud providers, along with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. I think it won’t be long until we’re training a variety of cloud careers across all major players.',\n",

Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”',\n",

Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”',\n",

Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”',\n",

       "   'AWS, Google, Azure, Red Hat, CompTIA…these are big names in IT! And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you’re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What’s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won’t get you the job.',\n",
       "   'Certifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying “This person knows their stuff.” Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.',\n",
       "   'Many roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don’t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.',\n",
       "   'Obtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:',\n",
       "   'At the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you’re standing in the ring, it’s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.',\n",
       "   'Additionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it’s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don’t apply to most real-world software development.',\n",
       "   'At Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in – you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here’s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it’s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you’ll have the cert, but you’ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you’ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won’t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.',\n",
       "   'Alternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.',\n",

She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.',\n",

I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me.

One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own.

For starters, we’re licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission. We’re also approved by the SAA Texas Veterans Commission to accept VA Benefits, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting. This already gives us a premier status and a trusted brand name. But there’s one missing piece that would take us to the next level: an accrediting body. Now, we’re well on our way there! We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000).',\n",

The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students. This could be huge for our applicants, as it would significantly expand access to financial aid and allow even more people to change their lives by launching a tech career at Codeup. We would also be the first and only\\xa0career accelerator with MSA-CSS\\xa0accreditation in Texas. One article even states that coding bootcamps, in general, are not accredited.',\n",

Now that we’re candidates, we are actively working with the MSA-CSS to meet or exceed the requirements for accreditation. This process usually takes 18-24 months. Once approved, it would be an additional 12-18 months for Title IV acceptance, which is what would enable students to receive federal loans.',\n",
       "   'As the Premier Career Accelerator in Texas, we are thrilled about this news. Adding this layer of compliance and quality assurance will significantly improve the quality of education we provide and the way that we provide it.

Many try learning a new skill with free modules or self-paced courses to save money, but when you lack that human guidance, what happens when you don’t know what to learn next? What happens when you need more explaining or can’t figure out what you did wrong? What if you lose motivation and start to give up? Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career.',\n",

It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You’ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up.',\n",

However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you’ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none.',\n",
       "   'Not only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time.

I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.',\n",
       "   'But as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: “I never have to go to school EVER again…” As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'But I felt lost. If I wasn’t going to graduate school, I didn’t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I’d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Being bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'In reality, I felt lost. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn’t know what I wanted to “do”, then maybe I could build my skillset instead.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'My interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad.

I told myself I’d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates.\\xa0',\n",

After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn’t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I’d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'I was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was “selfish” and having a sense of purpose was a “luxury”. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap.',\n",

I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I’m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I’m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn.

       "   'A Java Developer is a developer whose work is largely focused on Java, which is both a programming language and a platform for application development. Many companies, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter, rely on Java for their websites. Java Developers are responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining Java applications. Such applications might include gaming websites, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more.',\n",

You will have learned to build web-based applications using Java, but it isn’t the only tool in your toolbox.

You will know about front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and will be able to work in either one or both. Click here to view our curriculum. Java Developers are much less focused on design, and much more focused on the program architecture. This role has a heavier focus on computer science, and the coding is limited mostly to Java. Codeup students that particularly loved their 100+ hours in Java might decide to specialize, and seek out a Java Developer role.',\n",

Most of the other jobs ranked on this list have under 10,000 job openings, and about half have less than 5,000. The median base salary across all levels of Java Developers is $90,830.

However, they might choose to specialize in one area based on their own preferences or business needs, and take on a role like a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Analytics Specialist.',\n",

       "   'This is the first section on our list because data science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don’t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes.

       "   'The field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it’s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn’t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists.',\n",
       "   'One reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master’s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don’t practice it, don’t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven’t built a data pipeline, don’t have project experience, etc., they aren’t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they’re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master’s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand.',\n",
       "   'So, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don’t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that’s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes!',\n",

More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it’s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand?

Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that’s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on.',\n",

Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your “free” time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You’ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends.',\n",

       "   'Questioning college? You and apparently millions of others! The COVID-19 pandemic has seen college in decline and bootcamps on the rise as people flock to shorter-term options that offer a clear career path and a marketable skillset. For some, it’s the newfound financial strain causing them to realize they need a new career ASAP and can’t spend 4 years and $50k to get it. A recent Wall Street Journal article even wonders, “Is This the End of College as We Know It?” Keep reading for our interpretation.',\n",

       "   'College is generally accepted as the thing to do after high school, but it wasn’t always that way. The “college for all” campaign originated during the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, when college was a luxury for the rich. It caused a racial and classist divide as those that couldn’t afford it took on trades. However, college is still a luxury for the rich. Only now, those that can’t afford it have to fight for scholarships and grants or bear the burden of student loan repayment for three, four, sometimes five or more decades. Thanks to student loan repayment, many feel forced to postpone life milestones, unable to finance a house or children while catching up on debt. In the midst of a pandemic, that financial strain is a risk people are more hesitant to take.',\n",
       "   'What’s the point of college, anyhow? Why insist that everyone should go even if it causes financial strain for decades? Well, because it’s supposed to give us the education we need to be successful, prepare us for the working world, and get us to a job where we can make use of our degree right after college. For the lucky few, that actually happened. The rest didn’t get the Return on Investment they hoped for. After college, they struggled to find their way, often winding up in career paths that don’t require their degree, but all the while, continuing to pay for it. A promised not delivered? Not exactly, because there was never a legal promise, just advice from everyone around them. An unfortunate debt and learning experience? Some may call it that.',\n",
       "   'So if not college, then what? Many are going against the grain, saving tens of thousands of dollars and years of their life in the process. Who’s profiting? Institutions that offer short-term training in a marketable skill, and their students. The pandemic has loomed upon us for about a year now, and in that year, short-term credential classes saw an enrollment spike of 8 million students, a 70% increase from just before COVID-19. Meanwhile, enrollment of freshmen in college dropped 16%. Going this route, even students are profiting, as they’re able to start earning income much faster.',\n",
       "   'While short-term classes in more traditional trade careers, like electricians, mechanics, plumbing, and some health care professions have been around since 1879, coding bootcamps are really at the heart of this spike.

We get questions like this all the time from prospective students. To make sure you’re successful in your career transition, let’s first set up some expectations about what you can expect before, during, and after Codeup.

Give yourself a month to carefully understand and complete the prework we assign when you’re accepted, which was made to help you practice active learning and problem-solving. You’ll soon find that programming is all about practice and getting that muscle memory, like learning to play an instrument. You will thank yourself if you finish it, and risk falling behind if you don’t.',\n",
       "   'In order to complete the prework, you’ll need to apply early. Why? Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You’ll need to be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework. The multi-step application process can take several weeks to over a month. Combining the prework timeframe plus the application timeframe means you should apply seven weeks before your start date. This will also give you enough time to secure grant funding, if applicable, as that also takes about a month to be processed. You can learn more about our application process here.\\xa0',\n",

You should also arrive at your workstation with coffee in tow 30 minutes before class starts so that you can map out your schedule for the day, and review what questions you have going into lecture. Combining office hours, planning, and practicing, you can expect to be occupied from 8am to 7 or 8pm almost daily.',\n",

We strongly suggest you avoid working outside of class, as this typically results in poor classroom performance, and we really want you to do well. If you have to work, calculate the bare minimum you need to earn each week in order to get by. Then, spread out your workload to do a little bit here and there throughout the week rather than full days on the weekends, because you do need rest days! The best options are flexible jobs where you’re in charge of your own schedule, such as food delivery, rideshare, dog walking, babysitting, etc. This is not the time to take an overnight shift at your current job or start your own business.',\n",

Since you’ll have an online curriculum to read through and refer back to, write notes on what you don’t understand during reading, practice, or lecture. It’s good to track what exactly doesn’t make sense and what you’ve tried that didn’t work so you can ask more targeted questions, whether to peers, Google, or instructors. This way, you’re building yourself a roadmap to follow when you return to your studies each day.',\n",

You can do all the reading you want, watch all the video tutorials, and still not know how to code if you don’t actually code. There’s no cramming for exams, no writing research papers. It’s continuous learning and adding to your arsenal through a few additional hours of study/practice every day.',\n",
       "   'In order to make the most of your experience, build on skills, and help yourself for the job search in the long run, you’ll be encouraged to attend meetups, join community Slack channels, and try to meet others in the industry to build your support network, so you have plenty of people to ask for help.

This is important to keep up after graduating Codeup to keep your coding skills fresh, and so that potential employers can see that you’re actively working on your craft.',\n",

If you were to apply for our Data Science program a couple weeks before class starts, knowing nothing about Python or stats, our Admissions Manager will be happy to provide all the necessary resources you need for a future start date, but you may not be qualified in time for the next class start, considering you’d also have to finish pre-work in that limited time.\\xa0',\n",

       "   '“It’s very applied. You put what you learn into use and you learn why you learned it that way. In collegiate, you’ll take a test but it’s not quite the same thing as getting your hands dirty and figuring it out. Your mind can drift during lecture and you don’t really “get” it until you do a project. But since you’re doing a project on almost every topic at Codeup, that really solidified the topics we were learning for me.” – Brandi',\n",
       "   '“I could not name one programming language. I didn’t know anything. The prework was the first time I wrote a line of code. With Codeup, they will start you from the very beginning of learning programming, it’s just fast-paced.” – Katy',\n",
       "   '“Just get your hands dirty and do it! Once you’re working on it, it turns out it’s not as bad or as hard as you thought it was. Because you don’t know it, it seems like this amazing, glorious thing in the sky but when you actually work on it you’re like ‘oh, it was just that, that’s no big deal.’ All you have to do is try and apply yourself and you’ll figure it out.” – Brandi',\n",
       "   '“The first project we had, our instructor had to go away for the weekend so we couldn’t contact her. The whole class collectively could not come up with an answer to the problem. We were freaking out thinking like ‘We did something wrong. Why can we not figure it out? She left us!’ We were so scared. When she came back she said ‘you learned a really important lesson, and that’s that sometimes there is no answer to the question. You just need to be able to look at the data and take it for what it is.’ You can’t make things up based on the data you find. You have to come up with real conclusions. That one hit me pretty hard and I never forgot it.” – Katy',\n",
       "   '“The prework is the best thing you can do for yourself coming into the program. We didn’t go in knowing everything and memorizing it all, and they didn’t expect us to either. You just have to know basic concepts. Like understand that there’s a way to do something and maybe not necessarily know how yet but know that there’s a way. So just being exposed to it ahead of time is helpful.” – Katy',\n",
       "   '“I really liked being remote. Being in class, it was distracting. My classmates, we were best friends basically while we were going through the program. So we were constantly chatting and everything. But once it was remote it was all quiet. There was nobody distracting me, and I could focus on what I was doing.We could still chat when I wanted to but I could turn off chat when I needed to. Also when the teachers were talking, I had my dual monitors, so I was able to look up what they were talking about and it really solidified what I was learning. So, I got a lot out of it.” – Brandi',\n",
       "   '“They are not messing around! I mean, they start early and they leave no stone unturned! They come in and they’re completely revamping your Linkedin, email, photos, what you should and should not post. One-on-one meetings about what you’re looking for in a company and how they can help you get there, what connections they have, who to talk to, who to connect with. How to answer phone calls. Interview questions in class, like answering them together, answering them one-on-one. Mock interviews, resume building. Beginning to end, I mean, that alone was worth it to go through Codeup because no other place gives you that much attention on one single student, and everybody got that attention, and everybody got jobs! And that’s because of all the work they put into getting you ready not just technically, but professionally. They will get you there if you just listen to them and don’t fight back, don’t argue. Just do what they’re saying because they’ve done this enough times and they know what works. Just trust them.” – Katy',\n",

       "   'If you’ve been digging around our website or researching tech tools, you may have heard of Python. Python is a programming language that can be used by software developers, accountants, mathematicians, and especially, data scientists. Python is actually the dominant programming language in data science, often used for data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.',\n",
       "   'Python is an object-oriented language, meaning that the focus is on data and procedures rather than functions and logic. By writing out procedures, you can actually modify the data you have. It can help you automate mundane, repetitive tasks, such as downloading websites, changing the format of those websites, renaming those files, and uploading them to servers. With Python, you can program all of these tasks to be done automatically every time you download a website. This automation saves data scientists a lot of time.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Yes! One of the key features of Python is the short, easy to understand syntax in which you write your code. Its minimalistic nature allows you to focus on solving your problem rather than solving the code itself. It reads and feels more like English as compared to other common programming languages. Sometimes, what would take you 4 lines of code in Java can be done with 1 line of code in Python. Because it is a high-level language, meaning it is largely independent of your computer specifications, you can get started using Python on whatever device you have – even phones, tablets, or PlayStation!',\n",
       "   'Python can be used for data wrangling, data analysis, data visualizations, and applying machine learning algorithms. Data wrangling involves preparing raw data for use by parsing it, meaning to convert each data point to a standard format, and by cleaning it, which means to separate useful data from erroneous or missing data points. This is relatively easy if you have only a few data points, but parsing Big Data by hand, like a thousands-of-terabytes large list of every transaction a retail store has ever had, is out of the question. So, Python is used to automate these tasks. It’s also used for data analysis – helping you find trends, correlations, variations, and outliers; data visualizations – helping you chart or graph your findings to show to others; and machine learning, as the complex algorithms and workflows that it’s capable of make it great for Artificial Intelligence.',\n",

After deciding not to pursue law, she decided to go back to school for IT. Her job as an IT Specialist isn’t exactly what she had in mind, but her degree didn’t offer the coding experience necessary to become a developer, which was her true end goal. Even after moving to Hawaii and having two kids, that dream persisted. Her cousin, a developer, mentioned that some of her coworkers went to a coding bootcamp.

She very quickly realized this was not the case. “You have to speak up and you have to do it well, and often, with a lot of people. You’ll have to work hard, beyond the regular hours. Take advantage of all the resources. Schedule some meetups with peers to work together outside of class. It’s so worth it in the end. Just go for it!”',\n",

He was one of the only students ever to finish Codeup while working a job, rushing to work right after class. He regrets doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours. But when he had time, he always tried to work with other students to solve problems together, and encourages the same in others. “Break out of your comfort zone and don’t be scared to just start from where you are.

       "   '“Practical information and practical skills are going to be acquired by practicing every single day.” – Fernando',\n",
       "   'Practice is an essential part of learning something new. You could watch people bake all day long, and still not be any better of a baker yourself. That’s why our students spend more time actually writing code than listening to lectures. You’ll practice alone, with your cohort, and with instructor guidance. Through this practice, you will change the way you think and approach problems. The instructors agreed that practicing on your own through fun side projects, like creating a program to organize your baking recipes, sets the most successful students apart from the rest.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",

       "   'Don’t just practice. Practice consistently. Many of our students have tried the self-taught route and eventually ended up at Codeup. Why? Practicing every now and then doesn’t cut it when it comes to something as complex as programming, the same way practicing every now and then isn’t how you learn a language or an instrument. The way to succeed at something is by practicing it frequently and consistently. It’s no different for how to succeed in a coding bootcamp. Codeup is fully immersive for that very purpose.',\n",

We won’t take a grade on it, it’s really, entirely, to set yourself up for success. We will move incredibly fast and it will feel like drinking from a firehose, even if you did do the prework. Do future you a big favor by getting used to what drinking from a firehose feels like!',\n",

       "   '“Replace frustration with curiosity, then experimentation.” – Fernando',\n",
       "   'As you consistently practice the prework, you will come across errors. Instead of getting frustrated, let the errors trigger your curiosity of “why isn’t that working?” and “how do I get it to work?” You can google the keywords in the error message and figure out what to do. This gives you practice problem solving on your own instead of immediately asking someone else for help. While we love helping our students, we will expect you to have already tried to figure things out because we believe in your ability to problem solve. When you do need help, this process helps you frame your questions. We won’t give you answers, but we will happily point to a different way of thinking about an error. It will make getting it right that much more satisfying.',\n",

You’re giving yourself exposure to a topic before class so that during the lecture, you’re not discovering something new, but trying to understand it. You might not get it the first time you see it, but now you know what to look out for in the lecture.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '“Think about where you were 5 weeks ago. Use evidence over time that things have gotten better rather than dwelling on failure in the moment. Failure is learning. Failure is good.” – Douglas',\n",
       "   'As you progress through the program, you will face obstacles and failures, and you will doubt yourself as a programmer. When you feel like you can’t do something, compare yourself to who you were and what you could do 5 weeks ago, instead of comparing yourself to “real programmers.” After reminding yourself of your progress, think about what obstacles are keeping you from moving forward and how to overcome them, instead of defaulting to “I can’t.” Kevin Kelley once said, “Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.”',\n",

After studying and studying, Python just wasn’t clicking, and he failed one of his technical assessments. He was about to give up on it, but our admissions team wasn’t ready to give up on him.

They were both immersive experiences where people of different personalities and different cultures joined together for a common goal. As Jeff put it, you may not always like someone or relate to them, but you need each other to accomplish what needs to get done.',\n",

       "   '“But don’t I need a degree to get a job as a data scientist?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. The answer is yes and no. Yes, because most jobs in data science require some form of higher education. No, because that degree doesn’t have to be in something related to data science – data scientists have degrees in many different areas of study! So if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career, fear no more.',\n",
       "   'While a Master’s Degree provides a lot of value, it isn’t the most direct path for a job. With the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data, data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultra-specialized workforce. Companies now need much larger teams to analyze, model, and leverage the data they’ve collected. So while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development, it’s now a playground for those with some Python skills who know how to find valuable insights in a mess of data.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Now let’s get a bit more specific. If modern roles in data science demand more practical skills, why is a bootcamp a better path?',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#1: Responsive curriculum: Barely 10 years ago nobody had heard of data science. But in that short amount of time, the tools and technologies in the field have grown exponentially. Each year sees the introduction of new packages, visualization tools, and cutting edge technologies. With such a rapidly evolving landscape, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. With our ears tuned directly to employers, we’re able to adapt quickly and ensure we’re teaching what hiring managers need.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#2 Hands-on Project-Based Learning: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. A career in data science is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#3 Progressive Curriculum Structure: In a traditional degree, students study by taking several classes at a time. You may begin with data structures and algorithms, then move to SQL, then take Python, and so on. But real-world data science doesn’t work so neatly. You will never face a project where you’re only working with one of those tools, so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demands. Our program focuses on real-world deliverables at every step of the journey, while exposing you to increasingly complex problems and projects. You start off applying basic tools to simple challenges. Then, we begin varying the data sets, the way you access that data, the type of methodology you use, and the deliverable you’re responsible for. To put it simply, the structure of a traditional degree teaches you how to use a hammer, a saw, and a chisel. Codeup teaches you how to build a stool, a birdbox, and a sculpture with those tools, and when to use which.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#4 Job Placement Services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most graduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#5 Messy Data: This is probably the most important difference between us and traditional degrees. We use real, messy, misleading, broken data so you learn how to draw insights from the real thing. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. Because of the segmented class structure, traditional degrees have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill. At Codeup, you’re always applying your tools to a real deliverable, so we’re able to use real data sets that intersect the challenges of multiple skills.\\xa0',\n",

I was hungry for success and ready to transition from a “job” to a “career,” but I did not know what would get me there. After conducting a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the tech industry is where I wanted to get started, specifically as a web developer. Unfortunately, when I did a Google search for “coding bootcamp,” I came across about 6,000,000 results. Some programs offered courses online, in-person, or a combination of the two. As for the financial options, programs either offered financial assistance or none at all. I was having a difficult time choosing the best program for me because I was left with so many questions.',\n",

I wanted an in-person experience because I needed an environment that would help me find the success I was after. As I did my research on Codeup, it became clear that they were going to provide the best experience for me.',\n",

I had an amazing cohort that shared the journey with me and I can confidently say that I have made lifelong friends. I was also surrounded by an amazing network of alumni, staff, employer partners, and the tech community in San Antonio. Everything about Codeup is so much more effective because it is in-person. One of my favorite experiences at Codeup was the career simulation and preparation. I was able to work one-on-one with a professional that is going to help place me in my first web developer position.

In this post, we want to explore how to think about a bootcamp curriculum and recommend strategies about how to consider the best fit.',\n",

The front-end is the user-facing side that you interact within a web browser. The back-end is the server-side that involves the sending and receiving of data. Consider a restaurant website. A front-end only website would show a restaurant menu with prices, dishes, and ordering information. A full-stack web application would allow you to not only view the menu but place an order and process payment information for that order, interacting with a database and back-end functionality.',\n",

       "   'With so many technologies out there, it can be hard to pick what’s best to learn. But here’s the secret: the specific technologies do not matter. The most important thing you’ll learn during a coding bootcamp is how to use these different categories of technologies. Whether you learn PHP or Java, MySQL, or\\xa0 SQL Server, the important takeaways are the fundamental concepts learned. Many Codeup alumni graduate from our Full-Stack Java program and go on to work in PHP, Python, Ruby, Groovy, and other languages. Ultimately, a loop is a loop and an array is an array. Languages differ, but once you’ve learned an OOP language, the differences become syntactical instead of conceptual.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'This leads us to an important point: the more technologies, the worse! The quality of a curriculum, and thus the value of it, is not defined by the number of technologies covered. In fact, it’s the opposite. Let’s give some examples.',\n",
       "   'Columbia University is one of the premier academic institutions in the world. They are an Ivy League university with a strong reputation. In 2018, they expanded into the bootcamp space and launched a web development program that covers the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more. All of that in 12 weeks. Let’s decode that for you with the terms we’ve already used. This curriculum promises to teach you:',\n",
       "   'Now let’s look at Codeup. We teach: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Spring, MySQL. All of that, in 22 weeks. In the terms we’ve discussed, that’s:\\xa0',\n",
       "   'The common initial thought is: why spend 22 weeks learning seven technologies when you could spend 12 weeks learning 10? And there lies the misconception. Many bootcamp curricula promise to teach you the latest and greatest technologies: React.js, Angular.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, etc. etc. etc. That may sound like a better bang for your buck, but it’s all a question of priority. Here is the reality of your choices:',\n",
       "   'There is no inherently right answer here – it’s all about your priorities. That being said, here’s what we believe: Learning how to learn, learning how to think like a developer, and learning to program is far more important than gaining exposure to the latest web frameworks. When you understand programming fundamentals, you prepare yourself to learn whatever you want.

The entirety of the rest of your tuition can be arranged with a combination of scholarships, grants, and loans to support the remaining investment. Our dedicated Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager helps you navigate all the intricacies of tuition planning (if you want to get a head start, read our blog about bootcamp funding, explained).',\n",
       "   'Codeup focuses on quality. While other bootcamps leveraged venture-funding and corporate capital to expand quickly, opening 10+ campuses at a time, Codeup opened one campus. While other programs focused on volume, we focused on quality. We spent five years refining our program before expanding. Here’s the result that you now get to enjoy:',\n",
       "   'If you’re considering a bootcamp education, you’re really considering an investment in yourself. Let’s be really clear – this is NOT school.

Put on your investment hat: the upfront $$ isn’t as important as the Return On Investment. Our Dallas-bound graduates have had an average starting salary of $85,000. At less than 6 months long, you still have more than 6 months to work in that year. So what is your ROI? In the same year you are trained, you earn back your money.

       "   '“Don’t I need a Computer Science degree to get a job as a software developer?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. Prospective students often compare us to four year degrees in CS with the concern that lacking a piece of paper and formal degree will prevent them from getting a job. We’re here to tell you once and for all: college is NOT the best way to become a software developer.',\n",
       "   'For the avoidance of doubt, there is a lot of merit to a four year degree, as well as a lot of valuable knowledge from a CS program that can apply to life as a developer. However, if your goal is to get a job as a software developer, there’s a more direct path.',\n",
       "   'Think of it this way:my plumbing is old and broken, and I need to replace it all. I hire a PhD in Fluid Dynamics – someone who really understands flow, gravity, resistance, momentum, and all the intricacies of what’s happening in my pipes. They come and explain how everything is supposed to work in my new pipes, charge me $5,000 for their time, and then leave. With my pipes still broken, I decided to hire a plumber – someone who knows how to identify the problem and fix it,and a week later my plumbing is fully functional and I’ve only spent $2,500. [Note, we kind of made these numbers up to illustrate a point. After all, we’re no drain surgeons.]',\n",
       "   'The message here is simple: theory is not the same thing as practical experience. With the rapid growth in web and IT, we’re no longer just dealing with cutting-edge technologies. Development is becoming the new blue-collar factory work, and the amount of code out there is astounding. It’s no longer as important to have high-level abstract education. Instead, the top priority is up-to-date practical experience.',\n",
       "   'Now, let’s get more specific. Why exactly is a coding bootcamp the better way to get a job as a software developer?',\n",
       "   '#1 Technologies: Technology changes at the speed of light. One day the popular framework is Angular, and the next it’s React. In one generation, companies are building with C++ and in the next they’re building with Java. Because of this rate of change, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. While they continue to teach C++, we’ve moved on to Java with a Spring framework and MySQL database. Because we’re more agile, we are able to keep pace with industry trends.',\n",
       "   '#2 Curriculum structure: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduce amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. This career is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.',\n",
       "   '#3 Job placement services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most undergraduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#4 Programming hours: This is similar to number 2, but so important that it’s worth repeating. The single most important thing a would-be developer can do is spend time writing code. Practice, practice, practice is the lesson above all else. You need to engage with the problem-solving cycle, learn how to fail, and learn to overcome the barriers inherent in programming. It’s a lot like learning an instrument. When you start out, you struggle to play single notes. You then practice scales and exercises, and before long you’re playing songs, thinking about the intonation and sound over playing the notes. With programming, you need to spend hours to get the basics under your fingers in order to graduate to complex problem-solving and application development. At Codeup, you spend 670 hours in hands-on, instructor-led classroom time. For those of you who like math, that’s roughly equivalent to the number of hours in a four-year degree. It just happens in 6 months, and those hours are hands-on.',\n",
       "   'If you’re still not convinced, consider the story of Po. Po graduated from Trinity University with a 4 year degree in Computer Science. He graduated with a good GPA, but couldn’t find work as a web developer for a whole year. Companies told him he didn’t have enough full-stack experience, a big enough portfolio, and was lacking modern technologies and languages. So, he came to Codeup. He paired his theory knowledge with our practical knowledge and landed a job immediately upon graduation. Since then, he’s moved to Dallas to join Cognizant, where he’s been able to double his salary and move into a new position as a lead developer. Learn more about Po’s journey here.',\n",

I have enjoyed an 18 year career in tech, during which I’ve worked at companies ranging from small startups to Fortune 50 and made my way up through the ranks to Senior Developer.

Here’s why!',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#1: Codeup has a well-thought-out and high-quality curriculum. Not only that, but it teaches programming fundamentals. Some bootcamps teach programs that cover a dozen different technologies: React, Angular, Node, Ruby, Rails, Mongo DB, MySQL, Python, etc. As a developer, I can tell you: that’s crazy. Instead of a list of keywords, I discovered Codeup teaches a narrow scope of technologies with a focus on teaching students how to learn software development, giving them the power to go learn whatever technologies they want.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#2: Codeup promises, and follows through, to refund 100% of a student’s tuition if they don’t find a job after graduation. A lot of places say, ‘Hey come on over, we’ll help!’ I knew Codeup was for real and not just a money grab when they told me: “if a student does everything they’re supposed to and doesn’t find a job, that’s on us, not them.”',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   '#3: Codeup has an impressive network of employer partners. They place graduates at companies like USAA, Accenture, Oracle, SWBC, and other large companies with a reputation. Having worked at a bootcamp, I know exactly how hard it is to get a company like USAA to consider bootcamp grads. That upped their cred in my book WAY high.',\n",

       "   'Started in 2013, San Antonio-based Codeup has been making a name for itself and helping bolster Texas’ tech and startup scene by training the next group of software developers. Now, after honing its curriculum and strengthening its ties across the state, Codeup is ready to open its second campus in Dallas.',\n",
       "   'Near the end of November, with the greenlight from the Texas Workforce Commission, the company began accepting applications for its first North Texas cohort that will begin in downtown Dallas in early 2020. It plans to have about 3 cohorts go through its 20-week program, graduating between 50 to 75 people next year.',\n",
       "   '“It seems to make good sense that we should be here; the number of jobs is more than the number of people that can do them and that’s what makes it such a great opportunity right now,”\\xa0Jason Straughan, CEO and co-founder of Codeup, told NTX Inno. “We want to make sure that we are getting the people that come through our classes jobs, we want our Dallas cohorts to have the same or better employment rates than they do in San Antonio.”',\n",
       "   'What started in the corner of a coworking space in San Antonio, with people walking in and out of the space while trying to teach the class, has quickly become a well-recognized organizations for helping people transition into coding and data careers. It started with a problem Straughan and his fellow co-founders noticed in the industry. Applicants would come in for interviews at their respective companies with a wealth of knowledge about theory, but when it came to practicality and implementation, they seemed to be lacking.',\n",
       "   '“We were talking about how college is teaching people to be computer scientists like you would teach an astronomer how a telescope works,” Straughan said.',\n",
       "   'So Codeup was launched with a simple premise – teach software development like you would teach a skilled trade, with immersive learning. Over the course of the company’s 20-week program, students start coding on day one. The classes go from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by the end of it, students log about 630 classroom hours of direct experience.',\n",
       "   '“It’s day one you start writing code,” Straughan said. “How do you learn German? You speak it. How do you learn to code? It’s fingers on keyboards, and so that’s what we do.”',\n",
       "   'Codeup distinguishes itself from the numerous other similar programs out there in that it is outcome-driven, rather than profit-motivated. The co-founders of the organization are all involved in the tech industry outside of Codeup, allowing them to focus more on the curriculum than a business plan. Straughan said that in the beginning, instead of thinking about what students want to learn, Codeup went directly to the companies that would be hiring graduates and asked what skills were needed.',\n",
       "   'This has given Codeup a high job placement rate for its graduates, with more than 98 percent of alumni finding jobs in the industry. Codeup stands by its program, offering graduates a complete refund if they are unable to find a software-related job within six months.',\n",
       "   '“Now that we are growing, we’re trying to do it slow to make sure that we maintain that kind of quality on the output, because we think that’s the long-term goal,” Straughan said. “We think it’s actually the most responsible way to deliver and education product.”',\n",
       "   'Straughan credits Codeup’s 28-member team with the success of the company. The connections made from previous graduates has, in part, driven Codeup’s expansion to Dallas. In the past year, the organization has placed 17 graduates in the North Texas area with large companies like USAA and Cognizant. In addition, he said that the growth of the tech industry in the region has made it attractive not only for its relatively high tech salaries, but also because of the number of job openings.',\n",
       "   'When it opens next year in Dallas, Codeup will also focus on helping drive diversity and inclusion in the local tech workforce. The company strives to have cohorts that represent the larger demographics of the region. It also offers scholarships for disadvantaged and minority residents looking to apply. Straughan said that it is something the tech industry should be talking about more, because the software that is being developed is used by all types of people, and those people should be represented at the development of the software as well.',\n",
       "   '“I think one of the other things we really enjoy about Codeup is when I entered software development, almost everybody in that career looked like me – they were all white dudes that liked to play with computers… the industry is changing and it is becoming more diverse, and I think we have an opportunity to help kickstart that and speed up that process,” he said. “I realized that the impact we are making is really a cool experience, it’s moving to me, it really is a purpose.”',\n",

       "   'Bootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend.',\n",
       "   'My first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in.',\n",
       "   'Secondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don’t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don’t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there.',\n",
       "   'Warning!—only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later.',\n",
       "   'Lastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don’t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don’t pay anything until you get your first job.',\n",
       "   'As for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist.',\n",
       "   'I will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding.',\n",
       "   'All in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.',\n",

       "   'After the graduation of our first Codeup Data Science cohort, one company was eagerly waiting in the wings to scoop up a lot of our new grads: Quickpath. In business since 2004, Quickpath has helped deliver amazing customer experiences and optimize business decisions in over a hundred implementations for Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000 companies. But as the demand for their services increased—more than doubling each of the past three years—Quickpath found itself in a talent shortage.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '“We found ourselves leaving business on the table where customers were asking us for additional resources,” Alex Fly, CEO of Quickpath and board member of the Codeup Data Science program, said, “and we weren’t able to fill that request.”',\n",
       "   'Fortunately, the Codeup Data Science curriculum was able to provide a much-needed pipeline of highly skilled individuals. Over the course of an intense 20-week, hands-on program, students learn a variety of data science tools and skills, including statistics, SQL, Python and regression analysis. This intense preparation, culminating in mastery with a capstone project, is what led Fly to hire not one, but three of our Codeup grads from the inaugural Data Science cohort.',\n",
       "   'Codeup Data Science Grads Making an Immediate Impact',\n",
       "   'Quickpath is a company that plays data science as a team sport—they really help their clients with all operations around data rather than simply creating a model. This means that Quickpath helps their clients in all the following areas:\\xa0',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Quickpath hired the three Codeup grads as data and machine learning (ML) engineers to work on tasks that come both before and after data model creation.

       "   'One individual, in particular, had been on the receiving end of information from a data science model. In their previous position as an analyst in fraud detection, they would receive data model outputs in order to assess whether transactions were fraudulent.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'After completing the Codeup Data Science program, this person now sits on the other side of the fence and has the ability to wrangle the data, develop a model and evaluate its success. His professional experience is what sets him apart: he keenly understands how front-line employees will interact with the data that he provides. Fly believes it’s this kind of professional experience that empowers Codeup graduates to hit the ground running.\\xa0',\n",
       "   'But there’s something more than just previous professional experience. It’s also the sense that Codeup graduates are intrinsically motivated to make a major career change. As our first 2019 Data Science outcomes report noted, 77% of the class had a bachelor’s degree or higher. A person looking to change careers who invests in a 20-week program shows not only moxie but also curiosity.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '“Data science is constantly moving and evolving at a very high pace. There’s a new library, modeling or deep learning framework coming out literally every week—you’ve got to constantly stay on top of your game,” Fly explained. “So being able to identify folks who are lifelong learners has been a critical success factor for our hiring profile. We found a pretty high concentration of those folks at Codeup.”\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

And for those looking to enroll in a future Codeup Data Science boot camp, he has two pieces of advice.',\n",
       "   'First, Fly emphasizes the importance of data, data, data, underscoring that it’s more important than all the algorithms of the world. He believes data preparation is the most fundamental skill to master.\\xa0',\n",
       "   '“An average data scientist with really good data will always be able to build a better model than an expert data scientist with data,” Fly stressed.',\n",

       "   'For some, it may be difficult to grasp how prevalent data science is in our world! We’ve written a post here that brings to life some of the ways in which you may see data science in your everyday routine. However, you may find yourself wondering exactly how far-reaching data science actually is, or how it actually impacts certain industries or companies. In this post, I’ll go a little deeper into these topics.',\n",
       "   'For one, data science has been a major player in industries like manufacturing and retail. For example, in manufacturing, data science is utilized from an insight-driven perspective. Simply put, it’s how businesses use data to figure out how to best utilize their resources when making and producing a large-scale product they’re trying to sell to customers. For instance, a business may collect data on how the customer interacts with the product in order to figure out what features are most profitable to produce. They may also collect data related to how well the machinery is operating on the production line so they can analyze weak points and optimize efficiency. For example, Ford utilizes wireless connections and in-vehicle sensors to capture insights on driver behavior as well as ways to increase production speed.',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'In retail, we also see a similar move towards an insight-driven perspective, one that allows businesses to use predictive analytics by utilizing data from product reviews, call center records, and social media streams. On a merchandising front, businesses like Target and Walmart may even utilize data collected from video footage or track heat signatures in order to improve layout and product placements. If you have ever wondered why you can’t walk out of Target without spending at least a hundred bucks, now you know why! Basic industrial-organizational psychology usually places the most utilized items, like milk and eggs, in a place further into the store so that customers must walk past a plethora of products that they don’t need but may end up buying due to product placement. ',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'What has become even more significant than brick-and-mortar stores, however, are online retailers, such as Amazon. Because of the huge variety of items to choose from, many customers may feel overwhelmed by how many options there are when they visit the website. However, because Amazon is so great at collecting data on customers and then turning that raw data into valuable predictors, they make it much easier for the average consumer to buy products suited for them. For example, to figure out what items to recommend users, they collect data on what items that user browses through and what they end up buying. Amazon also takes into account the user’s shipping address, which lets them reliably predict what income a user may have. ',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'All these little tidbits of information allow them to build a 360-degree model of who this individual so that they can associate them with a group of people that also have the same identifiers. Grouping users can help Amazon make assumptions about what you will buy based on what others buy in your grouping. If you buy Burt’s Bees Lip Balm with a predicted income of 53k, they may come to the conclusion that people in this category also have a high rate of buying Bounty Quick-Size Paper Towels, which they can then recommend you buy next. In many ways, it’s exactly like what Target does with product placement when someone walks into the store. However, because Amazon lacks a physical storefront they must instead strategically place products around the web page in order to create the same passerby effect. \\xa0',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'On a larger scale, this is essentially how advertising works on all the social media platforms you may find yourself scrolling through. One one hand, they may collect data on you in order to predict which advertisements your group of users may relate with. However, they may also track your individual data and essentially stalk you with little bits of code called cookies. For example, one time while scrolling through Instagram, I saw an ad for my absolute favorite chai brand that’s manufactured in the town of my alma mater, the University of Colorado at Boulder. I caught myself thinking, “ How in the world did they know?” The ad was so specific to my preferences that it caught me off guard. I’m assuming at some point I had Googled this brand of chai and the browser cookies were used by Instagram to target users with that specific interest, which is in general how most targeted advertising works. The weird part is, I couldn’t recall ever Googling it… ',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'The fact of the matter is, many businesses are collecting data on behaviors you may not even realize. Some say that Facebook records users through their phones or that Alexa is listening to you without your knowledge. The truth is, we have reached an age in which data is a highly valued commodity. As demonstrated by the near failure of footwear company Timberland, how a company uses data can either make or break them. As data becomes increasingly important in our world, the demand for data scientists will be even higher. \\xa0',\n",

       "   'First of all, we view your tuition as an investment in your future, and we put our best people, ideas, and efforts to make that investment fruitful. But we also want to make that investment more accessible by providing as many financial pathways as possible for tuition funding. As we approach their annual fundraising luncheon this week, we want to highlight Project QUEST as one of the most effective such pathways you can explore.',\n",
       "   '“The experience of attending Codeup has radically altered my life. Now, instead of financially treading water in a service industry job with a college degree that felt wasted, I have a fulfilling professional career with exciting possibilities for in-field advancement.” – Madeleine Capper',\n",
       "   'Project QUEST is a San Antonio based non-profit dedicated to workforce development and building our city’s future economy. They provide grant funding for educational and training programs, as well as career coaching and support resources (like utilities, childcare, and transportation). Over the last 4 years, Project QUEST and Codeup have collaborated to help dozens of students change careers.',\n",

       "   'In 2019 alone, Project QUEST has helped Codeup train 23 Software Developers and Data Scientists. Those students received grant funding (i.e. free money) anywhere from $2,000 to a full tuition ride, allowing them to fully focus on their education. Our combined efforts help empower life change, resulting in a 92% completion rate and a 95% employment rate of students receiving Project QUEST funding. And when we say life change, we mean it. The average starting salary leaving our program for Project QUEST participants this year was $59,000! That’s the salary floor, and there’s no ceiling. Considering that many of Project QUEST’s participants come from backgrounds of under or unemployment, these are generationally impactful numbers.',\n",

       "   'Just a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: “Try replacing ‘should’ with ‘want’ and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your ‘should’ and your ‘want’ are aligned.” Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn’t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn’t completely sure about?',\n",
       "   'With this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I’m not really a super logical person… Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses… and finally landing a dream job?! It’s a colorful blur.',\n",
       "   'So that’s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.',\n",
       "   'This was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn’t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I’m in over my head and that I don’t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I’m already doing it. The truth is, it isn’t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn’t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to.',\n",
       "   'Let me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves “I’m just going to be a barista forever, because that’s who I am” or “My personality only suits being in a teacher, so I’m not going to try something different.” The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there’s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career.',\n",
       "   'There are days where indeed this is the case for me, just “heads down coding”, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don’t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we’re not stepping on each other’s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I’m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don’t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.',\n",
       "   'Most of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They’re only a few keystrokes away. ',\n",
       "   'One thing to note about the technology field is that it’s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education.',\n",
       "   'Although basic computer skills are necessary for success, it’s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you’re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can’t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to – all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I’ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned.',\n",
       "   'As you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don’t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don’t have to define your journey.',\n",

       "   'You come home from work, tired to the bone and groaning as you realize you forgot to prep dinner tonight. So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google “restaurants near me”. You scroll down the list of places to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the ratings are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it’s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it’s open… the list goes on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hours have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurants around you are closed… and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. ',\n",
       "   'A week later, life finds you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there’s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!',\n",

       "   'This very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let’s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data. ',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Before we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'A simple action such as filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment.',\n",
       "   '\\xa0',\n",
       "   'Another important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. ',\n",
       "   'So how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of shows that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. ',\n",
       "   'Similarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   'As the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

For one, it may be an effective way to just get started on something you have been meaning to do for awhile, and as Mark Twain noted, “Half of getting ahead is getting started.”',\n",
       "   'On top of that, it gets rid of any excuses about “not having enough time”. Because it’s a short sprint, most people will begin prioritizing it differently. As different items on your daily to-do list begin to demand your time, you begin to prioritize the things that matter. Especially if you are a goal-oriented person, the satisfaction of completing a challenge like this may force you to prioritize it over other things. This may be the impetus you need to create lasting habits, ideally even after the challenge is over. However, over-enthusiastic participants may have to be wary of burnout or of a short-term “high”. Make sure to use that momentum and keep on keeping on!',\n",
       "   'If you Google “coding 30-day challenge”, a multitude of options pop up. These challenges hypothetically can be done at any time, but doing it in January can be a powerful experience as you make a commitment to investing in yourself in 2019. Some popular coding challenges include the #Javascript30 by developer Wes Bos, the 30 day challenge at TechGig, and the 30 Days of Code by HackerRank.

       "   'In four months, a lot can change.\\xa0Four months: A San Antonio winter, a long distance relationship, a college semester. ',\n",
       "   'During my four months at Codeup, I pursued what felt like an unattainable goal and actually reached it. When I tell people that I’ve been coding less than a year and am now working as a software developer, people are usually impressed. But to be frank, I could never have done that without attending a coding boot camp like Codeup. It was a short four-month process that was like stumbling from a dusty, old wardrobe into Narnia: on one side, a clumsy and unenlightened beginner and thereafter being transformed by a completely new and fantastical world. Attending Codeup armed me with the experience and knowledge that allowed me to survive the harsh winter landscape that starting out from scratch as a software developer can be. ',\n",
       "   'Now as I am working at my first real job, I’m grateful to Codeup for teaching me several things that allowed me to be better prepared for my career.',\n",
       "   'From beginning to end, Codeup placed a huge emphasis on group exercises. The beginning of the course was characterized by paired programming, a process in which one person is the navigator and one is the driver. As the names suggest, the navigator communicates with the person at the keyboard and directs them to type certain bits of code or navigate to specific elements on the page. Often, we would flip-flop between these roles so both students could get a crack at practicing one of two things: Firstly, we practiced how to communicate clearly and efficiently. Secondly, we learned how to take direction and ask clarifying questions. ',\n",
       "   'At the time, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was with paired programming and why the instructors at Codeup had made it such an integral part of the curriculum. However, as I go about my everyday duties at work, I realized how often I engage in informal bouts of paired programming. Although we have a Wikipedia-style knowledge base at my work where we document our processes, a lot of knowledge is still transferred orally (not ideal, but we’re working on it!). What this means is that paired programming happens on a daily basis. If a developer is having a complex problem, it is usually easier for a coworker who has solved this problem before to sit down and walk them through it rather than try to explain things via chat or email.',\n",
       "   'Towards the end of the semester, we coalesced into group projects in which the primary focus was teamwork. This was where we got a taste of working independently but in a team effort. It was during the group projects that I discovered the importance of learning how to use a versioning control system, such as GitHub, that allowed multiple developers to participate on the same project without stepping on any toes. When I started my job at Armor, I realized how much more complex versioning control can get when you have potentially 50+ people contributing to the same repository at any given time. I had to relearn the fundamentals and be extra careful not to overwrite someone else’s work. Most mistakes are reversible, but the headache of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it is usually a source of distraction from a developer’s daily duties and sprint goals.',\n",
       "   'When I initially started at Codeup, I found myself wanting to ask the instructors questions as soon as I got stuck on something. However, I quickly realized that their resources were limited since there were only 2 of them (plus 1-2 fellows) in a class of 30. Although this wasn’t ideal, it actually did simulate a real-life scenario that parallels a professional working environment. At my work, there are probably only 2 or 3 lead developers. However, \\xa0they are constantly inundated with requests by QE and other junior developers, code review, and demands from management. If you need to make a request, best make it quick and efficient. ',\n",
       "   'I then remembered what instructors had mentioned during Codeup. They taught us that if you have a question, make sure you present it in a format such as:',\n",
       "   'This made it so that students would actually try to figure out a solution before shooting their hand up every time they had a problem, only to find that they could have easily solved it with a little more digging. In my experience, most experienced developers are usually happy to help. However, it’s good practice to make sure to demonstrate you tried your best and that you’re not wasting their precious time. ',\n",
       "   'Throughout the boot camp, it came to be a running joke that everyone would have an emotional breakdown at least once during their time at Codeup. You would see someone walk off and come back with teary, red eyes. Or for some, they would vocalize their despair: “I don’t think I’m cut out for this.”, “This is too hard.”, “I’m so frustrated!”, “Maybe I should just give up.” I myself broke down emotionally several times during Codeup and reiterated several mental self-doubts to myself: “Maybe I should have stuck to the arts. I’m too emotional to do well in computer science. I’ll never be good enough”. On some days, you would feel accomplished and confident in your abilities. On other days, the doubts would flood in unexpectedly and endanger everything I had worked so hard for. However, through the support of other students in the class, the instructors, and the encouragement of the staff, I was able to succeed throughout the course and completed my Demo Day project. ',\n",
       "   'All this is to say, Codeup taught me to have emotional fortitude and a confidence to believe in myself. Because to be honest, the first several months at my job also felt like an emotional roller coaster. I was thrown into an environment where I had to learn and adapt very quickly. \\xa0I was constantly afraid and timid because I was the only female developer and also the most junior developer. I expected a lot out of myself, and when I was given criticism I would internally berate myself until my negative self-talk had multiplied the original piece of criticism in my mind ten-fold of what it actually was.',\n",
       "   'However, my experience at Codeup had taught me to push through in those moments of self-doubt. It gave me a thicker skin in order to ask for help, to learn quickly amidst a ton of ambiguity, and most importantly, a realization that it will always get better as long as I don’t give up',\n",
       "   'As you might have noticed, none of the points above are actually related to the technical knowledge I received by attending Codeup and how it affected my career. It goes without saying that Codeup provided me with the coding skills I needed to be succeed in my career. However, another point that our instructors emphasized was that Codeup was not a comprehensive coding academy or computer science degree. In some ways, it was like a tour bus that allowed you a brief overview of all the major stops in the area. ',\n",
       "   'It allowed us to have the impetus and catalytic energy to start off a software development career. It also gave us the tools to quickly be able to pick up any technologies our companies were using. ',\n",
       "   '“We’re teaching you how to learn,” they would say throughout the course. After starting my first job, I came to realize how true this statement was. I imagined myself trying to pick up the technologies at my job without having Codeup as a primer and it seemed near impossible.',\n",
       "   'Needless to say, Codeup was an essential experience I needed on the way to becoming a full-time software developer. I learned critical skills that have proved invaluable in my day-to-day and have allowed me to be where I am today.',\n",

       "   'Almost every day since graduating from Codeup in December 2017, I have meditated over how much my life has changed in such a short period of time. Especially during this Thanksgiving season, I took the time to reflect even more deeply about the top three reasons I am grateful for Codeup. I am thankful for: ',\n",
       "   'When they say that Codeup is a “career accelerator,” they are not joking! In just 18 weeks, you graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the industry as a junior developer. ',\n",
       "   'When I was first searching for options to learn how to code, I was told that any college degree program would take me two to four full-time years, or four or more part-time years, to finish. As we all know, our bills do not get put on hold while we are in school! ',\n",
       "   'I also looked into free or inexpensive part-time programs so that I could continue to work full-time, and although I would describe myself as diligent and able to handle self-study, this would also have been a long route, and without the career advice and connections Codeup provides. Knowing what I know now, I am so glad I didn’t try to study on my own. The depth of Codeup’s curriculum, compared to some online training I have tried, is unmatched and very important to have in my current work as a developer.',\n",
       "   'When you think about it, 18 weeks is a blip in your life, especially when that blip of time in Codeup very quickly produces a return on your investment. Remember to consider wages lost when making your decision: your time is VALUABLE, and time spent not in the workforce is wages lost that you could have been making. Speaking of finances, I am also thankful for…',\n",
       "   'Did you know that many students receive internal scholarships and financial help from Codeup’s funding partners? I, too, had sticker shock when I saw the price tag, but I ended up receiving Codeup’s Women in Tech scholarship, as well as a grant from Project Quest, which greatly reduced my cost. For the remaining balance, I utilized one of Codeup’s loan partners, which offers reduced payments while in school, and for two months after. Read more about my journey through Codeup here. Last but not least, I am thankful for…',\n",
       "   'Until just a few years ago, I had never in my life met a computer programmer. I was not aware that this was a thriving career, or that development and IT jobs occupy many of the slots on Glassdoor’s list of top careers. For several years, I was stuck in another field that was not for me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to get my foot in the door of this industry that seemed like it would better suit me and my needs. However, I did not have any connections in the industry or the direction needed to do this myself.',\n",
       "   'Codeup provided access to the tech field to me, as a woman who knew nothing about code prior to attending, and as someone who constantly doubted (and still do sometimes) whether I would be able to grasp what I had heard was very difficult subject matter. They saw potential in my aptitude and, more importantly, in my attitude. ',\n",
       "   'Life since Codeup has been incredible. My job is fun, challenging, and stimulating; most of the time, it feels like I’m working on jigsaw puzzles all day. The hours just fly by, and I can’t believe I’m getting paid for this! Sometimes, when that pesky ol’ imposter syndrome pops up, a coworker of mine will brag about the quality or speed of my work to my supervisor, and I’ll feel validated and appreciated all over again, despite my newness to the field. Financially, I also feel appreciated, as I am now a skilled worker in high demand. In fact, in less than a year since graduating from Codeup, I was able to purchase my first home, all by myself!',\n",
       "   'This truly has been a life changing year. Codeup got me in the door of the tech industry, and where I go from here is up to me.

       "   'I looked at Codeup for 2 years before I finally made the decision to apply. As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. ',\n",
       "   'The online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn’t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup’s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn’t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup’s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, “Will I get a job afterwards?”',\n",
       "   'I learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers’ requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup’s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn’t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I’m doing now. My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner.',\n",

Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what’s best for my family, and transition careers.',\n",

       "   'Early on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: “The most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.” This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don’t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? “A happy family and nothing else” is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it’s time to figure out how to get there.',\n",

       "   'After spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.',\n",

       "   'After getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move. \\xa0I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. “What a relief,” I thought. It was good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn’t do it. ',\n",
       "   'Finding a Job with Only Cooking Experience',\n",
       "   'After graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.',\n",

       "   'I got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.',\n",
