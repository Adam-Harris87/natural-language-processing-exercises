       "  'content': 'If you’re interested in embarking on a career in tech, it is likely that you have taken a look into two learning paths: self-learning vs. coding bootcamps. But what are the differences?\\nSelf-Learning\\nMany online institutions offer self-learning courses. This is becoming increasingly popular as students are becoming more aware of their individual learning styles, and value flexibility and self-paced programs.\\nAdvantages of Self-Learning\\n\\nYou can form your instruction at times that best suit your needs and lifestyle\\nYou can purse your new path from the comfort of your home if you choose!\\nThere are many self-learning courses that offer flexible payment options\\n\\nDisadvantages of Self-Learning\\n\\nWorking alone can sometimes lead to a lack of motivation, requiring a great deal of strictness to remain on track\\nThere are no peers or instructors physically present to study with or ask questions\\n\\nTraditional Coding Bootcamp\\nCoding bootcamps have a reputation for being the accelerated path to launching a career in tech. This tends to work best for students that thrive off of structured learning, with a support team to assist throughout the process.\\nAdvantages of Coding Bootcamps\\n\\nBootcamps are typically instructor-led meaning you have access to industry experts throughout your program to help you fully understand the material\\nYou and your peers will more than likely need to complete a project together before the end of your course. This will aid in forming connections with the next group of individuals to enter the tech industry (which is great for networking!)\\nTo employers, completing a program through a coding bootcamp looks phenomenal! This demonstrates your ability to commit to something complex and learn quickly.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Coding Bootcamps\\n\\nEvery piece of information covered in a coding bootcamp’s curriculum may not be imperative to your new role. A top goal of a bootcamp is to lay a good foundation for many possible careers. This means that if the curriculum covers pieces you may already know, or that do not exactly pertain to you, you will still need to be actively involved in the lessons.\\nIf you are someone who prefers to spend a lot of time absorbing information, you may not be given the opportunity to do so, given that a bootcamp has a structured curriculum with time frames for each topic.\\n\\nBoth options have their advantages and disadvantages, but selecting which path is the correct choice for you should be based on your learning style and life circumstances.\\nCodeup\\nCodeup is the first, and currently the only accredited* coding bootcamp in Texas. Our program offerings range from 15 to 20 weeks and include: Full-Stack Web Development, Data Science and Cloud Administration. These programs are open to individuals of all backgrounds and experience levels.\\nWhen you decide to transition careers with Codeup, our commitment to you goes beyond class-time.

       "  'content': 'Many people start their career journeys early in life. As we learn more about ourselves and grow in our lives, we may find that we’ve outgrown our careers. That’s ok. Below you’ll find six key signs that it is time to change your career.\\nSigns It is Time to Change Careers\\nExpectations have increased, while your pay has not\\nOften, if you’ve been with your company for a while, it becomes easy to accept more responsibility. Over time, you may realize your level of responsibility has grown tremendously, but your pay has not. While your pay should not be everything when evaluating your employment, it is important to be fairly compensated for what is expected of you.\\nYou do not feel valued\\nOften feeling unappreciated can stem from a company overlooking you for a promotion, failure to re-evaluate your compensation, or simply overworking you. Regardless of the reason, feeling undervalued can quickly lead to burnout. If your company is not willing to make the necessary changes to reflect your value, it may be time to look elsewhere.\\nYour interests and passions have changed\\nSometimes the desire for change does not come from the work, it may be coming from you. We may find our interests shift over time, and this is normal. What we once loved, may no longer be something we find passion in. If this is the case, it is alright to consider a career change to find your new passion.\\nYou are not fulfilled in your work\\nAt Codeup we believe you should love your Mondays, and if work no longer excites you, and you dread going to work, you may be lacking fulfillment in your career.\\nThere is no room for advancement\\nNo one wants to remain stagnant. If progression in your career seems unlikely, you may want to have a conversation with someone on your leadership team to discuss growth potential. If there is no room for advancement in your current company it may be time for a career change.\\nYou have a toxic boss or work environment\\nToxicity in the workplace is highly unacceptable. If your work environment or superiors exhibit toxic behavior you should consider a change before those actions begin to affect your mental health.\\n\\xa0\\nCareer changes can be scary. If you are considering leaving your current career for a new one, take a look at a career in tech. Beyond being lucrative, there are many benefits to coding careers.\\nCodeup is well equipped to handle career transitions. We offer several scholarships and financial aid offerings to help make jumpstarting your career in tech feasible. We also offer a tuition refund guarantee. This guarantee is a refund of your paid tuition if you do not land a job in-field within six months of completing a Codeup program.\\nWe have three different programs, and we would love to help you decide which is a good fit for you. We offer 100% free instructor-led workshops. These workshops are designed to give you a taste of what you’ll learn in our programs, as well as give you information on financial aid and admissions.

Today we will highlight some benefits that come with learning to code.\\nBenefits of Learning to Code\\nThe Industry Needs You\\nThere is no question that our world and needs as a society are ever-changing. As new technological developments continue to arise, those capable of creating, maintaining, and operating that technology are highly valuable.\\nSo what does that mean? This means that cloud architects, machine learning engineers, web developers, and so many other tech professionals are extremely sought after in the tech workforce to continue to protect and grow these developments.\\nYour Value\\nIf you are a tech professional with skills that are in high demand, you are instantly more valuable. This means that your earning potential is significantly higher, as tech is a very lucrative industry. Essentially, learning to code will help get you hired, and set you apart from other candidates.\\nWork-Life Balance\\nMany people elect to do freelance work with their coding capabilities. This allows for more control over your schedule, with rates set by you, your choice of which projects to work on, and a very healthy work-life balance. Freelancing comes with freedom.\\nFulfillment\\nPeople who consider themselves creative individuals are able to tap into their creativity and apply it to their work as coders. Doing work that you can genuinely enjoy provides fulfillment for most.\\nA Healthy Challenge\\nWith a career in coding, you will be continuously learning and improving your problem-solving skills. This sort of challenge in the workplace is a healthy way to test your abilities and grow in your field.\\nCodeup’s Programs\\nIf you’re interested in a career in tech, we may have a program that is right for you. We offer three different accelerated courses: Cloud Administration, Data Science, and Full-Stack Web Development.\\nIn an effort to ease hesitation about our programs, we offer a tuition refund guarantee. This guarantee is a refund of your paid tuition if you do not land a job in-field within six months of completing a Codeup program.\\nNo prior experience is required to get started with Codeup. Employers place a high value on a good candidate with the skills they’re looking for, as opposed to a candidate with years of experience, and none of the skills they need. With Codeup, you’ll gain both experience and the skills necessary to land a job.\\nIf you are unsure of which program may be right for you, consider attending our 100% free instructor-led workshops.

We would like to lend a hand in comparing programs, and shed some light on key similarities and differences between Codeup and a degree.\\nKey Differences\\n1. Time Commitment\\nCodeup’s programs range from 15 to 20 weeks. They are full-time courses requiring students to be in class from 9 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday.\\nOn average, a full-time enrollee obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science can expect to commit four years, or 208 weeks.\\n2.

Student Experience/Support Team\\nCodeup has crafted a student experience team to see you through your journey with us. This team ensures you have everything you need to be successful in a Codeup program, and will also ensure you have support through any personal obstacles that may arise.\\nOur student experience team compares to a college advisor or counselor. The extent of a counselor’s involvement often depends on the college or university, however, the concept of having a support system through your educational journey is similar.\\n\\xa0\\nThe ultimate decision between a computer science degree and a coding bootcamp should be made after careful consideration and weighing of your options. Base your decision on requirements for your personal situation, and select the program that works best with your circumstance.\\nCodeup aims to deliver excellence and give our students a great education and a great experience.

If you’re speaking it’s because you have something to say.”\\n“Don’t over apologize (I do this way too often).”\\n“Be open and willing to speak up to your colleagues on how they can be supportive to everyone in the environment.”\\n“Band with other women to support each other on y’alls journey.”\\n“Find a mentor (and don’t limit yourself to just women mentors, as there aren’t many out there). A mentor can help you establish your career goals, navigate your journey, provide emotional support or motivation, and ultimately help you succeed.”\\n“Do not dismiss or shrug off “humor.” Call out racist, sexist, ableist, etc., comments. Stop letting work colleagues get away with bad behavior. Do this quickly, so it isn’t something that continues to happen.”\\n“Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The other three guys that were hired at the same time as I was NEVER asked any questions, but it turns out they were just as lost as I was. Once I started asking questions in our training meetings, they all started asking away as well! I thought they all understood what was going on, and being the only female in the group, I didn’t want to stick out. This had been holding me back. Instead of being afraid that you will come off as “not getting it”, you will instead hear “That’s a really good question!” or “I’m glad you asked that!”.”\\n“We belong here. Remind yourself of that when you doubt yourself. Because you will. I did. But I belong. And you do, too. So say it like a mantra – I belong here. And believe it.”\\n\\nCodeup works hard to close the gender inequality gap, and to diversify the tech world by producing a unique blend of tech talent. We also offer a Women in Tech scholarship open to anyone who identifies as a woman. Our goal is to make a career in tech accessible to all.\\nJoin us on our journey of empowering women in tech today!

From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.\\nCultivating Inclusive Growth\\nWe’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.\\nIn a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively.\\nWhy the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.\\nCodeup Initiatives\\nTo cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students.\\nEquipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town.\\xa0\\nNot only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.\\nIf you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way!

This includes members of our student experience team, career coaches, and the human resources department. This training was courtesy of the Center for Health Care Services in San Antonio. They graciously provided the funding and training for our team in this pilot training program.\\xa0\\nWhat is Mental Health First Aid? According to mentalhhealthfirstaid.org, “is a course that teaches you how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. The training gives you the skills you need to reach out and provide initial help and support to someone who may be developing a mental health or substance use problem or experiencing a crisis”.\\nTo be clear, our staff are not licensed, mental health professionals. What MHFA equips our staff with are tools to gauge risk and connect students and staff with the help they might need. This might include recognizing something in a meeting, picking up on cues during a casual conversation, or acting on a pattern behavior.\\xa0\\nHow does this help our students?\\nMany who go through Codeup’s programs will tell you it is both rewarding and challenging all at the same time. Some students have compared learning at Codeup to\\xa0 “drinking from a firehouse”. You learn so much at once, so fast. This style of learning if you are not used to it can be taxing on anyone’s mental fortitude. This allows our staff who work closely with the students to be able to identify if a student is in need of mental health help.\\xa0\\nConsider Your Career Change Today\\nWhy does this skill set matter?

       "  'content': 'Come Work In The Cloud\\nWhen your Monday rolls around, do you start to get a sense of dread? That might be a sign to break up with your current job and learn something new.\\xa0At Codeup, we don’t want you to keep your head in the clouds while working a job you can’t stand. You should learn all about the cloud and cloud technology!\\xa0As we charge forward into 2022, we recently announced our brand new Cloud Administration Program.\\xa0\\nThis is a 15-week career accelerator that gets you hands-on experience with:\\n\\nNetworking\\nLinux Operating System\\xa0\\nWindows Operating System\\xa0\\nSecurity\\xa0\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Technology\\n\\nYou’ll earn two industry-recognized certifications as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Both are included as part of your tuition. You will learn how to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\\xa0\\nHere are 5 reasons why we think you should attend our Cloud Administration program:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1.) The Campus\\xa0\\nLocated on Rackspace property, our Castle campus has everything you need.\\xa0Tabletop games to play with classmates on break? We got foosball and ping pong!\\xa0Need a drink to quench your thirst? We have complimentary soda, water, and tea.\\xa0\\nThere is also lots of seating across the campus for you to study, have lunch, or even meet with classmates.\\xa0\\nParking is free since we are located on Rackspace’s property. You have the option to park about 100 ft away from our building, or you can park on the underground level to save your car from the heat if you attend during the summer months.\\xa0\\nThere is also plenty of food options within driving distance of campus. Fast food options include Mcdonald’s, Panda Express, and Bill Miller’s BBQ. For more sit-down restaurant options, you can visit Applebee’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Olive Garden. If you want to bring your lunch we have microwaves and refrigerators to enjoy your lunch on campus.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.) Time and Money Spent\\xa0\\nIn just 15 weeks you will be on your way to a new career that’s in high demand! That means you won’t have to wait 2 – 4 years like other traditional degree plans to get started in your new career.\\xa0\\nIs the cost of our program a concern? We totally understand if it is. Our Cloud Administration program is also the most affordable option of our three programs at Codeup if you’re looking to save the most money. It’s also more affordable than a traditional degree.\\xa0\\nAt Codeup we have a dedicated team of Financial Aid and Enrollment managers who will work with you one on one to ensure you have everything you need to pay for your time at Codeup that makes sense for your individual situation.\\xa0\\nWe have grants, scholarships, and student loans for those who qualify. If you’re a Veteran or a dependant of a Veteran you might have GI Bill benefits for use at Codeup. We just launched an exclusive scholarship with Climb Credit that you can apply for here.\\xa0\\nLastly, you can always go through your own financial institution to see what options are available to pay for Codeup.\\xa0\\nCheck out a walkthrough of our financial aid options here.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.) Salary & Benefits\\xa0\\nAlmost everyone changing careers during the “Great Resignation” is doing it for better pay and better benefits.\\xa0\\nWhat if I told you that any career you obtain through our Cloud Administration program offered you both a better salary and better benefits?\\xa0\\nAccording to Indeed.com the average salary for a Cloud Engineer right now is $118,712 in Texas (which is similar to the National average). This mirrors a Glassdoor Median Base salary of $118,999. Glassdoor also notes a job satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 and over 10K open roles under the title Cloud Engineer.\\xa0\\nAre you guaranteed a salary like that after graduation? Not necessarily since this was an average salary. However, what that means is you have the potential to get to that level of salary at some point in your new career.\\nYour new skill sets could land you at a larger company like Accenture, EY, or even USAA. On the other hand, you could end up at a small company like a startup or SaaS (software as a service) company.\\xa0\\nBoth of those options will typically give you things like a great health care plan, generous amounts of time off, and additional perks like continuing education and gym discounts. Startups might be a little more unique in their offerings like remote work options, paying for new office equipment, and even potentially paying for an annual company retreat if the company works remotely.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.) Job Security\\nAccording to IT senior managers in a recent Robert Half survey, cloud expertise is the topmost in-demand skill set. This means cloud experts are in high demand and will continue to be as more companies adopt cloud infrastructures. The curriculum you go through in this program won’t stick you to just one lane. Coming out of the Cloud Administration program you could land a job as a:\\xa0\\n\\nCloud Engineer\\nCloud Network Engineer\\xa0\\nCloud Security Engineer\\xa0\\nCloud Architect\\xa0\\nCloud Administrator\\xa0\\n\\nHaving this many career options to choose from makes you a valuable and in-demand candidate for any tech company big or small. At Codeup, we have an employer-influenced curriculum. So once you graduate, you are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge today’s employers are looking for.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5.) Our Instructors Are Next Level\\xa0\\nOur instructors genuinely care about your success. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you the answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change.\\xa0\\nAt other boot camps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live interactive lectures and lab. Even at the college level, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. Our instructors make a difference in your learning journey.\\xa0\\nIf having awesome instructors wasn’t enough, we also have a dedicated Student Experience team. This team is designed to work in collaboration with our instructors to ensure your success. Need a one-on-one session with your instructor? They can help with that. Need help just managing your time better? They can help with that too! These are passionate education professionals who want to empower you to get to that finish line we call graduation!\\xa0\\nRead more about why you need the best coding Bootcamp instructors here.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWrapping Up\\nAs we mentioned, as more companies adopt cloud technologies the demand for cloud experts will only continue to grow. Take this as a sign to launch your career in tech and attend our brand new Cloud Administration program today.\\xa0\\nOur next class starts June 16th so don’t wait to get started and fill out this form here for our admissions team to get in touch with you.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/featured/our-acquisition-of-the-rackspace-cloud-academy-one-year-later/',\n",
       "  'content': 'Just about a year ago on April 16th, 2021 we announced our acquisition of the Rackspace Cloud Academy! For a short time after the acquisition, it was rebranded as the Codeup Cloud Academy and is now a full-time part of the Codeup brand. You can read our blog when we announced this last year by clicking here.\\xa0\\nTo look back at the past year, we checked in with Marcus Benavidez and Mike Jaime who stayed with Codeup after previously working with the Rackspace Cloud Academy. We also checked in with Dimitri Antoniou who is our VP of Strategic Initiatives and helped with the merger of the two companies. We asked them questions about the current campus, and also what the future may look like at Codeup’s new “Castle” campus.\\xa0\\nWhat makes Codeup’s new “Castle” campus so special?\\nMike Jamie: Its history! Rackspace and former Rackers were instrumental in jumpstarting the tech industry here in San Antonio. This includes Geekdom, where Codeup was established. The Castle is where Rackspace ultimately decided to call its international headquarters.\\xa0\\nMarcus Benavidez: The campus is designed with the student experience in mind. This includes the large classrooms and facilities to match. It’s a piece of San Antonio history as it’s on the Rackspace Campus.\\xa0\\nDimitri Antoniou: The Castle has been a staple of tech in San Antonio for years. Train new tech employees in high-growth careers like Cloud Administration from the Castle campus is an exciting extension of the legacy of Rackspace’s impact on San Antonio.\\nWhat new traditions have you created at the Castle or would to start since the acquisition?\\nMike: A way to implement a version of “Rookie O” across staff and cohorts.\\xa0\\nMarcus: I would love to see some kind of Alumni wall or recognition for Alumni past, present, and future.\\xa0\\nSince it’s been 1 yr since the acquisition, where do you see our Castle campus in 3, 5, or even 10 years from now?\\nMarcus: It will be awesome once Web Development and Data Science programs are approved on this campus. I am looking forward to the cross-pollination of technologies, students, and staff.\\xa0\\nDimitri: Maybe we will have our own mall to ourselves one day\\nWhat advice would you give to those considering our new Cloud Administration program?\\nMike: If you’re looking to get your foot in the door, I think it’s a no-brainer as you will be learning AWS administration, which is the most in-demand cloud computing platform. Also, the decision to focus on hands-on experience and know-how as opposed to certification exam memorization will better prepare students with practical knowledge.\\nMarcus: Do it. The time to positively impact your life and to create change is now.\\nDimitri: Skills in networking, Linux, and AWS can put you on a path to so many different careers, including cybersecurity and cloud architecture. These are some of the highest growth and most exciting pathways in technology. With experienced experts like Jeremy Price and Kris Connolly to teach you, there’s no better way to open doors in IT.\\nWhat programs could you see being delivered at the Castle campus in the future?\\nMike: Cybersecurity again! Also Web Development and Data Science as well.\\xa0\\nMarcus: We should continue to build and offer classes that align with the market [i.e. what skills are in high demand].\\xa0\\nDimitri: AWS is one of 3 major cloud providers, along with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. I think it won’t be long until we’re training a variety of cloud careers across all major players.\\nThe Castle has ping pong and foosball. What other indoor competitive game would you add?\\nMike: Air Hockey and Shuffle Board\\nMarcus: Vintage Arcade games would be awesome!\\xa0\\nDimitri: There’s so much open space – I’d love to run a nerf gun or dodgeball tournament!\\nJoin our new Cloud Administration Program\\nTinkerers, computer enthusiasts, mechanics, or really anyone who likes to fix and build things will love our brand new Cloud Administration program. The foundation of skills you will learn could land you a job in Cloud Architecture, Cybersecurity, DevOps, & Solutions Engineering. You will learn new skills in just 15 weeks, and won’t break the bank like a traditional 4-year college degree. Our next class starts on 5/31.\\xa0\\nOur Castle campus includes the following perks:\\xa0\\n\\nHands-on labs to get real-time hands-on experience\\nLive classroom instruction\\nPing pong and foosball tables\\xa0\\nLots of comfortable seating options to break out and study or just relax\\xa0\\nA large cafeteria area\\xa0\\nFree Coffee, Tea, Water, and Soda\\xa0\\nWe also have a vending machine for additional drinks and snacks\\xa0\\nFree covered parking\\xa0\\nLocated at Rackspace’s headquarters\\xa0\\n\\nIf you are looking to change your career, there is no better time than now!

Now, we are excited to announce our newest coming-soon program: Cloud Administration! Learn to build and manage cloud-based solutions.\\nWhat is the cloud? \\nIn short, the cloud lets you utilize the power of other people’s computers and infrastructure. Instead of having to run everything on your own computer (and dealing with pesky problems of storage, security, and reliability), you can instantly tap into the cloud to utilize the power of companies that specialize in these areas, like AWS, Google, and Microsoft.\\nWhy the cloud? \\nThe future is in the cloud! As the new way of doing business, all companies need to build or interact with cloud products. And these aren’t just high-tech solutions – they’re the core of everyday products like cloud-based gaming from Xbox, collaborative work tools from Google Drive, and even music streaming services from Spotify.\\nWhat will we learn? \\nThe Cloud Administration program will be a 15-week career accelerator that marries the best of our Systems Engineering and Cyber Cloud programs. With hands-on training in networking, Linux, Windows, security, and AWS Cloud, we’ll prepare you for entry-level jobs like Cloud Specialist, Cloud Administrator, and Cloud Engineer. Learn to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\\n\\nWho is this program for? \\nIf coding or statistics aren’t your things, but you’re interested in a career in tech, this is the program for you. Tinkerers, computer enthusiasts, mechanics, gamers – anyone who likes to fix and build things will love this program. With this foundation, students will be launched into IT towards careers in Cloud Architecture, Cybersecurity, DevOps, and Solutions Engineering.\\nWhen will the program launch? \\nWe anticipate starting our inaugural class in late May. With only 20 seats available in the inaugural class, space is limited.

       "  'content': 'On this International Women’s Day 2022 we wanted to tell stories about women in tech. What better way to do that than celebrate female authors! These women have written phenomenal books in the tech space to tell their stories. These are women who have walked the walk in the tech world and/or offered unique perspectives to not just women in tech, but women in the workplace. This list goes in no particular order as we believe you should add all of these to your kindle or book library asap. You can click on each book image to take you to a purchase page on Amazon.\\nLet’s dive into the list below:\\nReset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change by Ellen Pao\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world—and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFemale Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham\\xa0\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“This book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\\nInterviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTechnically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It’s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who’s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars.\\xa0\\nTechnically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use – and demand more from the companies behind them.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBrotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it’s a “Brotopia,” where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech’s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\\nBrotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“The last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\\nWhen Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\\nTwenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology’s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn’t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years–and the next twenty.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLet us know your thoughts on this list on social media!

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/it-training/it-certifications-101/',\n",
       "  'content': 'AWS, Google, Azure, Red Hat, CompTIA…these are big names in IT! And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you’re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What’s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won’t get you the job.\\nWhat are IT Certifications?\\nCertifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying “This person knows their stuff.” Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\\nWhy do IT Certifications matter to employers?\\nMany roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don’t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do they matter to you?\\nObtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\\n\\nYou will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\\nYou can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\\nYou obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\\nYou develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\\nYou will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\\n\\nWhy DON’T they matter to employers and you?\\nAt the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you’re standing in the ring, it’s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\\nAdditionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it’s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don’t apply to most real-world software development.\\nIf Certs matter AND don’t matter, what do I do?\\nAt Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in – you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here’s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it’s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you’ll have the cert, but you’ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you’ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won’t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\\nAlternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\\nIf you want to learn more about IT certification and training paths, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!'},\n",

To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn’t demand – it’s supply.\\nLuckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We’re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well-positioned to continue to lead our country’s defense – not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. \\nBut we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can’t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill® and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.\\nWant to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio’s tradition of protecting our city and country!'},\n",

       "  'content': 'As the end of military service gets closer, many transitioning service members often ask, “Can the GI Bill® pay for a coding bootcamp?” The answer is yes, but only if the coding bootcamp is on the VA-approved list.\\nThe GI Bill® will pay for college or a VA-approved coding bootcamp. For bootcamp programs, the VA uses a formula to calculate how much time to deduct from your benefits based on the program’s tuition and how it compares to average college costs.\\nThat’s good news for veterans looking for a second career in the technology sector. The tech industry is fast-paced, action-oriented, and often focused on completing small goals to accomplish large ones, a familiar process for those trained by the military. With average salaries for entry-level programmers averaging around $80,000, it’s a great time to learn how to code and get paid for your expertise.\\nWhy attend a coding bootcamp instead of college?\\nYou could always attend a two- or four-year college degree program in computer science and learn software development. Or you could train for these jobs by completing a specialized bootcamp program.\\nCoding bootcamps teach widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and PHP stacks through project-based learning. Students graduate from bootcamps with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills, and more. Most courses even help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network.\\nA bootcamp is an immersive, intense full-time learning environment. Students should prepare to scale back outside activities and give up full-time employment for the program’s course. Coding bootcamps vary in length from six to 28 weeks, although the average time is about 14 weeks long. Military service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status can often leverage terminal leave to attend a coding bootcamp.\\nIf you’re still wondering whether to choose a college program or a tech career accelerator, here are some points to consider:\\n\\nCollege isn’t for everyone. You may not have the time or money for four years of study or aren’t interested in all the extras that come with college life.\\nGI Bill® education benefits can pay for tuition, housing, and other associated costs of attending an approved bootcamp, much like when you attend college.\\nInterviewers for coding and developer jobs evaluate you on practical skills and experience, not your academic performance. Many bootcamps feature a Capstone project, in-depth work to solve a problem that becomes part of your portfolio so you can show potential employers what you can do.\\nMany bootcamps have job placement programs to help you find an internship or land a job after graduation.\\nIn some cases, bootcamp programs will offer a job guarantee within a certain amount of time after graduation, or they will refund your tuition costs.\\n\\nWhat should veterans look for in a Bootcamp?\\nA tech workforce development program usually translates into extensive, hands-on instruction in say, learning how to write code in less time than it takes to complete a two- or four-year degree program. Some bootcamps may be offered through established state or private universities, while some private providers offer training programs.\\nWhat should you look for in a bootcamp?\\n\\nThe bootcamp should meet the criteria as a VA-approved institution. Some coding schools may have only some programs that are GI Bill® eligible, but not others.\\nBootcamps typically can adapt to changes in the tech industry faster than a college. Ask if the curriculum incorporates feedback from industry partners and is updated to teach the latest practices.\\nCoding bootcamps should be training students in practical skills. Will you get to work with a client or organization on a project? See if the program you’re interested in offers a Capstone project or an internship as part of the curriculum.\\nA successful bootcamp ensures its students get the jobs they are trained to do, so check on job placement resources and guarantees. Resume help, interview training, and a robust network of industry partners interested in hiring graduates means better chances of getting that sought-after tech job.\\nA school offering a tuition refund guarantee is aligning its business incentives with the interests of its students. If students aren’t successful, then neither is the school. Look for a tuition policy that either defers tuition payment until employed in a qualified position or guarantees a refund should a student fail to land a tech job within a specific timeframe.\\n\\nIf you’re a veteran in Texas, Codeup offers GI Bill® eligible programs\\nTexas-based Codeup offers accelerated programs in San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, and Houston to help you launch your tech career. No previous experience is needed to participate in any of Codeup’s accelerator programs, all of which are GI Bill® eligible.\\nApply to Codeup’s full-stack web development to learn how to create an app or website from start to finish using today’s coding languages in just 20 weeks.Apply to Codeup’s systems engineering bootcamp if you’re up for problem-solving in information technology in this 13-week accelerator.Apply to Codeup’s data science bootcamp if you’d like to be a data scientist and learn how to apply machine learning models to make predictions and turn your insights into actionable recommendations over the course of 20 weeks.\\nYou’ll also get professional job application counseling and support as an ongoing part of our curriculum, which continues even after graduation. Veterans and their dependents may also apply for a Codeup scholarship to offset the amount of VA benefits used for tuition.\\nCodeup’s job guarantee means you’ll get hired for a tech job you’ve trained for within six months of graduating or receive a refund of 100% of your tuition.\\nFor more information on Codeup’s GI Bill® eligible bootcamp programs, reach out to one of our admissions specialists for more details or call us at 210-802-7289.\\nContributing Author Iris Gonzalez.'},\n",

You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what’s the difference, and which program is right for me?\\nBoth these programs are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:\\n\\nNetworking – Gain in-depth exposure to networks and topics across the OSI model,\\xa0 networks, protocols, and packet Capture, network analysis, and more.\\nLinux – Gain exposure and get hands-on configuring and maintaining the Linux operating system.\\nWindows – Exposure to the Windows Server 2012 R2 Operating System to learn server management functions using Server Manager and basic command-line utilities and tools to run from the command prompt.\\nAWS – Become familiar with key industry terms and concepts while building a foundation of cloud product knowledge across Amazon Web Services.\\n\\nNetworking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:\\n\\nCyber Cloud gets students certified in Security+ and AWS\\nSystems Engineering gets students certified in Network+ and Linux+\\n\\nNow that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:\\n\\nDo I have any technical work experience?\\nDo I have any training or education in IT?\\nDo you prefer solving open-ended and ambiguous problems, or concrete problems with solutions?\\nAre you interested in building and developing systems, or in securing and protecting systems?\\n\\nIf you don’t have any work or education in IT, the Systems Engineering program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?\\nOur programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don’t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up.\\nStill not sure which is right for you?

But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is Systems Engineering?\\nWhat is Systems Engineering?\\nIn IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:\\n\\nReviewing system logs for anomalies and issues\\nUpdating operating systems (OS)\\nInstalling new hardware and software\\nManaging user accounts\\nDocumenting information about the system setup\\nManaging file systems\\n\\nYou might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?\\n\\nNetworking – Networking skills include how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot networks, including using hardware like switches, routers, and firewalls. These skills and concepts are crucial to any systems engineering position. You not only need to understand them but also need some way to prove it. With the Network+ certification, job seekers can come to employers with proof of their networking know-how.\\nLinux- Linux is one of the most popular Operating Systems (OS). It is fully compatible with Mac OS and underpins all Android systems. In fact, the world’s IT infrastructure is run primarily on Linux. Certifications are the primary way technical folks prove their skills and Linux is no different. The CompTIA Linux+ certification is an entry-level certification that proves knowledge and basic technical proficiency in the job role\\nCloud – This involves using servers and tools (i.e. processing and storage hardware) that are based in a different location, instead of on-site. Our program introduces students to cloud concepts like storage, computing, permissions, and more!\\n\\nWhy Become a Systems Engineer?\\nNow you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.\\xa0 Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.\\n\\nThey are in demand! Companies rely on Sysadmins to keep all their IT running\\nYou’ll become a tech guru! You won’t just be the person who can fix the printer. You’ll also be the person who can script, work with servers, navigate AWS Cloud tools, and work on modern web technologies.\\nYou can specialize! With the breadth of knowledge you’ll obtain, you can have a specialized career in IT. Just hone in on one of your interests, whether it’s security, cloud, databases, or something that doesn’t even exist yet!\\n\\nInterested in learning more?

       "  'content': 'By: Alicia Gonzalez\\nBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.\\nThen one day as I was on my way to a patient’s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said “drive to a job you love” and I took it as a sign. I thought, “I want to drive to a job I love!” I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.\\nAt first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn’t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.\\nIt was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, “okay this IS what I wanted to be doing.” I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.\\nNow after graduating from Codeup, I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I’ve been here almost three months now and I’m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I’m doing and how far I’ve come since working here. I didn’t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don’t teach. It’s been really good.\\nI’m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I’m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I’m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I’m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn’t change a thing.'},\n",

Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career.\\nWhat You Need\\nIf you’re serious about changing careers, you gotta have a good instructor. It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You’ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up.\\nWhere To Find Them\\nLuckily, you can find the best of the best instructors at Codeup. They range in industry experience from entry-level to senior-level. However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you’ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none.\\nYour Personal Mentors\\nNot only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you an answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change.\\xa0\\nFeel ready to make a career change with a team of mentors to help guide you through it? Your mentor instructors will make sure you understand everything, are there when you reach a roadblock, and will keep you accountable to your learning with project-based assignments on a curriculum inspired by employers.

       " {'title': 'How I Went From Codeup to Business Owner',\n",
       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-went-from-codeup-to-business-owner/',\n",
       "  'content': 'Out of college, I was a bit of a mess. That’s what I would have told you, anyway. On the surface, I was put together. I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.\\nBut as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: “I never have to go to school EVER again…” As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away.\\xa0\\nBut I felt lost. If I wasn’t going to graduate school, I didn’t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I’d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college.\\xa0\\nBeing bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name.\\xa0\\nIn reality, I felt lost. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn’t know what I wanted to “do”, then maybe I could build my skillset instead.\\xa0\\nMy interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad. (are you noticing my habit of being idealistic yet?). Buoyed by this vision, I jumped all-in. I told myself I’d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates.\\xa0\\nIt worked. I landed a job in software development at a cloud security company in Dallas. After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn’t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I’d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that.\\xa0\\nI was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was “selfish” and having a sense of purpose was a “luxury”. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap.\\nIt was one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally felt like I was “with my people”, a collection of brainy empaths with crazy ideas. I learned so much about marketing in general, which allowed me to start up my side business as a coach. I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I’m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I’m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn. I’ve connected with other coaches, and built a supportive web of connections across the globe. I can’t believe how far I’ve come.\\xa0\\nBut I couldn’t have done it without first building my skills. In a world that penalizes people for not fitting into a neat career category, it can sometimes get confusing for people who have lots of interests. But I realized I didn’t get here by\\xa0trying\\xa0to become a business owner or learn about marketing. I was just, A, open to the opportunity, and B, perfectly positioned to do so.\\xa0\\nGoing through Codeup was a huge incentive for the Marketing manager to hire me, despite the fact I had ZERO marketing experience. They figured, hey, if she can learn full-stack in four months, she can definitely learn the lay of the land in marketing. My exposure to marketing gave me the necessary courage and skills to start getting my content out there. I was writing blogs, publishing podcasts, and releasing YouTube videos.\\nWith a clear mission and vision in mind, everything fell into place. It’s not that I suddenly have everything figured out; instead, I’ve gotten used to the uncertainty.\\xa0\\nI no longer worry about what my career is going to be. I know it’s not going to be “one thing”. I won’t be a coder, a writer, or a coach. I’ll be a coder-writer-coach-podcaster-marketer-salesperson-youtuber-novelist. Why choose, when I know I can make money from my unique mix of skills? Society often suggests we have to choose. But I refuse to believe that anymore.\\xa0\\nIf you’re reading this and you’re uncertain about where you’re headed, it’s\\xa0okay\\xa0not to have all the answers. Take things day by day. Build your skillset. Follow what you love. Aim for mastery.\\xa0\\nAnd don’t rule out the 9-to-5 doing something you may not love. Your job doesn’t have to be your passion. A steady paycheck does wonders for anxiety and allows you to be creative and innovate in your side-hustles.\\xa0\\nPractice gratitude. Realize that, yes, things could be worse, but they can also be better. Be patient with learning to wobble on the thin line stretched between “This is enough” and “I wonder what would happen if…”\\nGo down the rabbit holes. Be curious. And realize that life is about embracing the possibilities. Who knows where it can lead?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoyce Ling is a content creator and coach that helps dreamers fulfill their purpose by doing the work that matters most.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/coding-is-for-women/',\n",
       "  'content': 'In a world where 91.5% of developers are male, it’s important to remember that , too. Our first  event was a space for women interested in coding to come together (virtually) and learn from each other. Women tuned in from New York, Washington, New Mexico, and of course, our home base of Texas.\\xa0 The panelists for this event were two members of our instructional staff with experience working in the tech industry. Here’s what they had to say about the barriers, opportunities, and overall experience getting into and working in tech!\\n\\xa0\\nTell us about yourself.\\nMadeleine: I graduated from Codeup’s first Data Science cohort, worked as a Data Scientist for about 2 years, and now I’m back as a Data Science instructor! I love this institution [Codeup] and can’t stay away from it.\\nJasmine: I graduated from Codeup’s Web Development program last June. Now, I’m working at Codeup as a Graduate Fellow, and have a part-time job as a React Native developer.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat were you doing before entering the tech field?\\nMadeleine: I was a Starbucks barista and supervisor for 11 years. I went to college on and off, changed my major about 8 times, and had a two-year gap period. It was a long process by I ended up getting a Mathematics degree. I couldn’t find a way to utilize it, so that’s when I started looking into bootcamps. As soon as I graduated from Codeup, I immediately began working at Booz Allen Hamilton for a couple years.\\nJasmine: I was a Pharmacy Technician for about 7 years. I started as a cashier and worked my way up. I reached a point where there was no where else I could go. The next step would’ve been Pharmacist which I didn’t want to do, so I decided to pursue tech instead.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat made you decide coding is for you?\\nJasmine: As a pharm tech, I realized I was more interested in the software we were using than the medicine, and didn’t want to deal with the general public. I became curious about why the little Java coffee cup was popping up on my screen every day and started getting interested in the behind-the-scenes of the platform we were using. I knew that I could do it because there are a lot of transferable skills between the two careers.\\nMadeleine: I got some experience programming in college, but it sat in the background and didn’t mesh well with my degree. After college, I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my degree so I started working aimlessly, not knowing what to do. As much as I sincerely loved the service industry, it’s almost impossible to make a sustainable living. I wanted to start utilizing my skills more. I heard about data science but didn’t know what it meant. I looked into it more right as Codeup was opening their Data Science program. It was the perfect fit to make use of\\xa0 my math, programming, and natural creative storytelling skills.\\n\\xa0\\nDid someone help push you towards tech?\\nJasmine: I graduated Codeup after the pandemic struck, and the job search started to feel really isolating. I found this support group of women who would meet up every week, talk about the job search, what leads we had, troubles we were having, and made connections that led to the job I have now. So, it’s really important to find community and find support during the hard times. The women in tech groups are strong support communities and support systems!\\nMadeleine: It was an old friend from high school, actually. After college, when I wasn’t really doing anything, we had reconnected. He had just signed up for a bootcamp, which was actually formerly Rackspace Cloud Academy, which is now Codeup Cloud Academy. He helped me understand how bootcamps can fill in the gaps of traditional academia, which tends to fail at helping people find satisfying careers. Then once I was in Codeup, I got so much guidance from the instructors and career advisors that I am very, very grateful for.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat was your first week like officially as a data scientist?\\nMadeleine: It was extremely daunting. I was shoved into this tech world after working in coffee shops my whole life. Booz Allen is a firm full of extremely talented people. I taught myself cybersecurity on my own. The other data scientists before me were a Doctor of Computer Science and an Astrophysicist. So, I was sitting here with my Bachelor’s degree and a bootcamp certificate thinking “okay, I hope I got this.” It turned out Codeup prepared way more than I anticipated in that context, where I was able to use my tools from Codeup to identify flaws in the methodologies that were being used. I was able to improve it on a pretty quick turnaround. I was really able to secure my footing and get a good reputation in the field before I even felt confident in what I was doing. The imposter syndrome may never really goes away but it was great to see that I can use the tools that I’ve learned even though I’m doubting myself.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat advice do you have to beat imposter syndrome? \\nJasmine: In my current role, I’m using a technology that we didn’t learn at Codeup, but Codeup taught me how to learn so I’m learning! I feel the imposter syndrome almost every day.\\xa0 I definitely felt like “What am I doing here? I have no idea what I’m doing.” Some advice I was given, and has helped me a lot, is keeping track of accomplishments you’ve done on the job. It’s great to look back on and see how much you can do and have done.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat advice do you have for women breaking into the industry?\\nJasmine: Learn how to learn. That’s how you’re going to get ahead, and that’s something I really learned at Codeup. We couldn’t learn everything, but when you learn how to learn, you can learn anything on your own.\\nMadeleine:\\xa0 You can’t learn everything! Don’t overburden yourself with what you should or could know. Keep studying what you enjoy naturally, persist, keep practicing. It may be hard to find a job but keep practicing. Don’t undervalue networking.\\n\\xa0\\nAny interview advice?\\nMadeleine: You will have technical interviews. What gets in the way for interviewers is a perceived lack of confidence. If you can’t sell yourself in that way, everything else as far as technical knowledge comes to a halt. Keep track of everything you can do as far as technical skills. Be able to fill dead air and answer questions even if you don’t know the answer. If you get to a question you don’t know, try to probe the interview to get to a mutual point that you do know. Try to slice through ambiguity, and have general conversational skills. Even if you can’t answer it directly, you can get to a point where you can elaborate on something you’re interested in tangentially, or connect with the interviewer in a different way. It could show off some other suspect of your talent, or at the very least, show confidence.\\nJasmine: At the end of the day, companies want to hire someone that will make a contribution. One way to show that is by doing your research on the interviewer and the company. Who are the higher-ups, who has been hired recently? Show that you are interested in them.\\n\\xa0\\nAny advice for the job search before the interviewing stage?\\nJasmine: Keep a spreadsheet of every single job you’ve applied to, what resume you sent them, and where you found them. Look for communities that you identify with and network with them. I am in a group for Latinx people in tech. When I’m being really targeted with looking for positions within my community, I get a better response.\\nMadeleine: Get involved in communities! Geekdom is a great place. I am involved in the Queer community in San Antonio. You might find yourself networking in places you didn’t initially expect, but get involved, and try to be as engaged as possible. Be yourself and show your personality if you want people to remember you. Women might be expected to be more demure, or submissive in the way they present themselves. But there’s a balance between not being perceived as aggressive, and still showing that you are confident in your skills or your personality.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat advice do you have to get good at coding?\\nJasmine: Go to a bootcamp! I was pretty self-motivated but I still wanted more of a push, more of a community, and structure. Codeup is a great way to learn how to code, but it’s not like riding a bike! You will forget how to code if you don’t code. Stay on it so you don’t fall off.\\nMadeleine: I’m a big fan of Codecademy if you’re just trying to get your feet wet and see if you like it. For data science, Data Camp is a great resource as well. Codecadamy can also help with Codeup’s Python pre-work and challenges during the admissions process.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat happens when you don’t know how to do something on the job?\\nJasmine: In my experience, employers expect that as a Junior Developer, you’re still learning and you are going to have to learn some things on the job. They don’t expect you to know everything, but they do expect you to be willing to learn and ready to hop in. In my position, I’m learning a new programming language on the job. At Codeup, you’ll learn how to learn a language quickly, and you can take that with you for when you get hired.\\nMadeleine: When I was at my previous company, I had to learn Deep Learning and Cybersecurity very quickly. They helped me out with getting certifications and offering stipends for learning resources. But conversely, when I wanted to grow personally in my data science skills, that was all self-taught and on my own time and from my network.\\n\\xa0\\nHuge “thank you” to Madeleine and Jasmine for joining us as panelists for this event! They’ve offered a wide wealth of resources and experiences to grow and learn from. To recap major points, learn how to learn, keep practicing, become confident in your skills, and be yourself when you network. There are plenty of female coders out there, and plenty of communities to join to meet like-minded women. Here in Texas, Women Who Code has communities in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. In San Antonio, check out Geekdom (a coworking space for all) and this Meetup community for women developers.

       "  'content': 'Every year, Glassdoor names the 50 Best Jobs in America. The year is 2021 and would you look at that? The top 2 Best Jobs in 2021 just happen to coincide with the two programs we have at Codeup! A true coincidence? We think not. We know what jobs are in demand, and what jobs will see growth well into the future. Let’s take a look at what these jobs are and why they top the list!\\n\\xa0\\n#1 Best Job: Java Developer\\nThe #1 Best Job is not Software Developer, Software Engineer, or Computer Scientist. It is specifically Java Developer. What does this mean?\\nA Java Developer is a developer whose work is largely focused on Java, which is both a programming language and a platform for application development. Many companies, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter, rely on Java for their websites. Java Developers are responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining Java applications. Such applications might include gaming websites, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more.\\nWhat you will be by the time you graduate Codeup is a full-stack web developer. You will have learned to build web-based applications using Java, but it isn’t the only tool in your toolbox. You’ll also be comfortable coding with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and can integrate various coding languages to develop an application. You will know about front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and will be able to work in either one or both. Click here to view our curriculum. Java Developers are much less focused on design, and much more focused on the program architecture. This role has a heavier focus on computer science, and the coding is limited mostly to Java. Codeup students that particularly loved their 100+ hours in Java might decide to specialize, and seek out a Java Developer role.\\nWhy is it the best?\\nGlassdoor determined the Best Jobs in 2021 based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. Java Developers have 10,103 job openings on Glassdoor. Most of the other jobs ranked on this list have under 10,000 job openings, and about half have less than 5,000. The median base salary across all levels of Java Developers is $90,830. The overall job satisfaction is 4.2 out of 5. This role is in-demand by employers, rated highly for job satisfaction, and pays very well.\\n\\xa0\\n#2 Best Job: Data Scientists\\nThe #2 Best Job is not Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst. It is a Data Scientist.\\nA Data Scientist (capital D, capital S) is a specific role that requires work across the entire data science pipeline. However, there are a number of roles a data scientist (lowercase D, lowercase S) can take! Their job title may not be “Data Scientist” but they can still work throughout the data science pipeline. However, they might choose to specialize in one area based on their own preferences or business needs, and take on a role like a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Analytics Specialist.\\nAfter Codeup, you will be a data scientist. You’ve been trained and have gained experience working throughout the entire data science pipeline, including data wrangling, which many programs neglect. Our collective goal is for you to be hire-able as a Data Scientist, but many grads end up taking a more specific role. Other alumni job titles include Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and People Analytics Specialist. To learn more about the various careers in data science, based on our alumni’s job titles, check out the blog “What Data Science Career is for You?”\\nWhy is it the second best?\\nAs mentioned above, Glassdoor decides these rankings based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. There are 5,971 job openings on Glassdoor for Data Scientists. The median base salary for Data Scientists of all levels is $113,736. The job satisfaction rating is 4.1 out of 5. This is a very high paying role with high satisfaction rankings. In fact, it topped the Best Jobs list for four consecutive years until 2020! While the number of job openings for Data Scientists may not look terribly high, the growth rate is 31%, which is very high! Keep in mind, too, that Glassdoor is counting the jobs for Data Scientists, and not all the millions of positions that a data scientist might specialize in.\\n\\xa0\\nThere’s certainly a reason these are the two programs we teach here at Codeup! They are the best jobs out there, in booming industries, and in very high demand for employers. They can also offer lots of stability, flexibility, and work-life balance. No wonder they’re the 2 Best Jobs of 2021!\\nStart one of the Best Jobs in 2021!\\nThinking about becoming a Java Developer for web-based applications?

       "  'content': 'We’re preaching to the choir to say that recruiting, hiring, and training employees costs companies a lot of time, energy, and money. Similarly, losing existing employees causes incalculable losses on institutional knowledge and team morale. Given that 71% of recent college grads leave their first job within their first year, modern employers face a crisis of confidence in hiring employees who are ready to commit. Fortunately, you can hire for the long haul with Codeup candidates that are ready to commit to growing in your company.\\n22 Months\\nThe average tenure of Codeup graduates in their first job is 22 months (2014-2019), almost double the norm for college grads. That means that for every Codeup grad you hire and employ, you would have to hire and employ TWO college graduates, resulting in more than double your HR costs.\\n53%\\n53% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are STILL employed at their first company. That means for more than half of your hires, you could hire an employee who sticks with you indefinitely.\\xa0\\n90%\\nBetween 2014-2021, 90% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are still employed in their fields of study. More broadly, most people change jobs 12 times throughout their career. You could hire someone who’s about to make 3 more career hops, or you could hire someone who is 9 times out of 10 landing in their final career change.\\nEmployers face a shifting workforce with shorter tenure, more job hopping, and less company loyalty, all of which add up to increased costs and decreased performance. Why do Codeup grads differ so drastically?\\n\\nWith an average age of 29 and 5-10 years of work experience, our grads have explored, failed, succeeded, experimented, and lived. They’ve made an intentional and committed choice to pursue this field, informed by experience.\\nThey’re career transitioners, which means they are looking to settle down. With families, houses, and previous careers, our grads aren’t looking to experiment; they’re looking to settle. They’re #marriagematerial, ready to make a commitment to one employer where they can grow and learn.\\nThey are well equipped as professionals, not just technologists, to succeed in their roles. Bringing their military, management, and other experiences to bear, they are ready to rise through the ranks into positions like CTO, Lead Developer, and Senior Developer.\\n\\nSave recruitment costs, increase employee tenure, and hire employees who want to join you for the long haul. \\nCurious how to get started?\\n\\nEmail us at partners@codeup.com so we can set up an introductory call.\\nWe’ll use that call to handpick candidates for you. If you’d like to start screening for yourself, head to codeup.com/my-story.\\nWe’ll facilitate and schedule interviews for you. If unsatisfied, we’ll use your feedback to find an even more tailored fit!\\nYou test run your hire. if it doesn’t work out within the first 2 weeks, we’ll refund their salary.\\n\\nReady to hire for the long haul?

Until we perfect cloning (which I hear our Data Science side of the house is working on…), you will always face the variability and risk of bringing on new talent. Fortunately, when you know who you’re hiring, you can improve your odds and further mitigate that risk. We can help!\\nKnow Your Codeup Candidate\\nWhen you hire from Codeup, you know who you’re hiring. Is it a Senior Developer with experience in CI/CD and streaming over web sockets? Nope. But you are consistently getting a developer who has 670+ hours of full-stack development experience, pair programming skills, learning agility, professionalism, and grit. Every time. Will it always be a perfect fit? No. Even when counting cards, there are no absolutes, but you can still play a much smarter hand.\\xa0 On top of those baseline qualifications, you are sourcing candidates from a pool of hungry and motivated developers, in which your future CTO or Lead Developer might be floating. Our grads stay with their first company for an average of 24 months.\\xa0 In an industry where roughly a 1 year tenure is the norm, that’s twice as long as most! They have been through life’s ups and downs, and they’re looking for a place to make a difference. \\nLet’s meet a few rockstar alums to show you who you might be hiring:\\n\\n\\n\\nBrian had never worked outside the service industry before Codeup. After graduation, he was hired as a Software Developer at a cutting-edge company. In just a few months, he got a $10,000 raise and was promoted to Lead Developer. Since then, he himself has hired multiple Codeup grads to work on his team. All within less than a year of becoming a developer. \\nNicole was interning in the political arena before Codeup. When she graduated, she was hired to help start a company’s data science department. She introduced them to programming with the tools she used at Codeup. A little over a year later, the company has tripled in size.\\nJoseph was a frozen yogurt store manager before Codeup. He joined Grok Interactive after graduation, where he became a Senior Developer within 2 years. Two years after that, he became the CEO of the company. Now, he is not only the CEO of Grok, but the CTO of another technology company called Dura Software. All within 6 years.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe you’re hiring your next lead, senior, or chief engineer! True, you might be hiring someone who doesn’t fit your culture or pace or tech stack or any other number of reasons employees don’t fit. You will always face risk, you know that and we know that. But when it doesn’t work out, we give you your money back. We boast an industry-first Salary Refund Guarantee: let go of a Codeup graduate within two weeks of hiring them and we will reimburse 100% of their payroll.\\xa0 With a best-case scenario of your next CEO and a worst case of a cash refund, are you ready to buy in? Get to know who you’re hiring at codeup.com/bio. If you would like to be matched with candidates (for free), email partners@codeup.com and we’ll schedule a call.

Launching a new career takes more than skill. You gotta have what it takes to get yourself seen and nail your interviews. Between our various professional development staff, each student will receive about 10 hours of individual coaching. Beyond that, you can set up as many 1 on 1 sessions with our Career Coaches as you want. You’ll have workshops and deliverables, both in the program and post-grad. We’ll personally review your resume and LinkedIn, and you’ll learn about the expectations of you as a professional and how to meet them. We’ll even help you nail your first impression with mock technical and behavioral interviews. \\nKeep in mind, we don’t do it all for you! We give you the tools and coaching, but you will be the one applying for jobs and implementing what you’ve learned. This isn’t your optional career help desk or a one-and-done session. This is an ongoing, baked-in part of the curriculum! You’ll come out of Codeup as a true tech professional.\\nYour Own Team of Recruiters\\nThe career guidance doesn’t end there! Imagine having a whole team of recruiters sending you applications, setting up interviews, proof-reading your cover letters, and coordinating your job search. Add to that the accountability it comes with. It’s like having a coach telling you what you need to do every day to get results, and how to learn from past mistakes. On top of that, you get to leverage our employer network of companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, Oracle, and Whole Foods. We are constantly forming new connections with employers to grow our network, thereby growing your network, as well as nurturing long-lasting partnerships.\\xa0\\nShowcasing You to Our Network\\nHow else  Through Codeup, hiring managers will see your face on our emails, social media, Youtube, your own dedicated page on our website, and a highlight of your final capstone project. Rather than sending a resume out into the ether and never knowing if anyone saw it, you can be certain that we’re showcasing you to every audience that we have. We even leverage our partners’ networks with similar marketing materials to help us reach new audiences. That is a lot of value!\\nWe’ll Continue to Have Your Back\\nIf you aren’t hired right after graduation, we will not leave you by the wayside. If it takes 6 months to find a job, that is how long your team of recruiters will work with you. When your skills are rusty and you’re just not getting those technical interviews, our Technical Career Coach will work with you even after graduation. If you don’t get a job within 6 months of graduating, you will get your money back. That peace of mind: priceless.\\nReady to take on your job search with us?

       "  'content': 'What do you look for in a career? Chances are, you’re looking for a way to make use of your particular talents, a field that’s secure and reliable, a work/life balance, and good compensation. For the right people, data science offers all of that and more! It was LinkedIn’s #1 Most Promising Job in 2019, and Glassdoor’s 2nd Best Job of 2021! Actually, Data Scientists topped that list from 2016 to 2019 before being dethroned by developers, which we also train at Codeup. So why all the hype? What makes it the best? Keep reading to learn !\\n\\xa0\\nUse Your Talents\\nDo your colleagues hate you for overanalyzing things? Have you found yourself turning everything into a spreadsheet? Do you make your life decisions based on careful calculations using past data? You might thrive as a data scientist!\\xa0\\nThis is the first section on our list because data science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don’t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes. Check out how much our students love what they do every week in this blog post.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe Field is BOOMING\\nThe field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it’s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn’t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists.\\nOne reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master’s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don’t practice it, don’t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven’t built a data pipeline, don’t have project experience, etc., they aren’t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they’re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master’s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand.\\nJob Security\\nSo, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don’t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that’s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes!\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Data Scientists as one of the fastest-growing occupations. They project a 31% growth rate with nearly 12 million new jobs between 2019 and 2029. More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it’s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand? Start a career with job security. Employers will always need humans to program the machines, understand the data pipeline, write the algorithms used by AI, and continue maintaining the tech and the data.\\nWork/Life Balance\\nMany of Codeup’s career transitioners know what it’s like to work in oilfields, call centers, food service, sales, retail, and teaching. The ones that don’t require manual labor or being on your feet all day still require odd hours, lots of emotional exertion, or giving up weekends. Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that’s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on.\\nWith a career in tech, you will very likely be working at a desk from 8 or 9am to 5 or 6pm with weekends off. You won’t be manual laboring, rushing to get someone to cover your shift, stressing about getting in hours, or speaking to customers or children all day long. Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your “free” time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You’ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends.\\nGreat Compensation and Benefits\\nInterested in boosting your earning potential? Data science is a lucrative field with a highly valuable skillset. You could potentially double your current salary with your very first in-field job. Your employer might also cover health insurance, provide retirement contributions, and offer flexible paid time off. Entry-level data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries around, with averages of:\\n\\nNationwide: $70,787 (ZipRecruiter)\\xa0\\nStatewide (Texas): $64,753 (ZipRecruiter)\\xa0\\nCitywide (San Antonio): $70,071 (ZipRecruiter)\\xa0\\n\\nAnd it’s only upward from there as your career progresses. In San Antonio, which is where our headquarters are, we’re seeing salary averages of:\\n\\nGeneral Data Scientist: $97,090 (ZipRecruiter)\\nSenior Level: $122,727 (ZipRecruiter)\\nTop Level: $161,892 (ZipRecruiter)\\n\\nWant to start earning six figures within a few years? Become a data scientist. With just a few years of experience, your talent becomes much more valuable. Keep reading to see how long it takes to advance.\\nRoom for Growth\\nIn the tech field, room for growth is limitless. There are always new technologies to learn and adapt to, new skills to perfect along the data pipeline, and career opportunities abound. The next step after beginning your career as a Junior Data Scientist is often Senior Data Scientist, which is the middle level. Typically, this requires 3-5 years of relevant work experience and the abilities to write reusable code, formulate machine learning algorithms, and build strong data pipelines in cloud environments.\\xa0\\nAfter senior is the top level, the most experienced member of the data science team. You may see them referred to with different titles, such as Vice President, Director, Head, or Chief. They lead the data science team, have over 5 years of experience, and are fluent or very well-versed along the data science pipeline. This person knows best practices for building and deploying a predictive model, can efficiently write code, and will know the highest impact projects to work on (TowardsDataScience).\\n\\xa0\\nSo, you’ve got a booming industry, a secure field, a skill set that’s in high demand, the ability to advance your career, a lucrative salary, a solid work/life balance, and to top it off, you get to do what you’re good at and passionate about. No wonder it’s the best job out there! If you enjoy working with data, this could be an incredibly fulfilling career path. Did you know it only takes 6 months to actually become a data scientist? Codeup will take you from “never heard of it” to your first job in-field. Interested? Apply now, then we’ll set up a call to discuss it further!'},\n",

Those are, of course, critical demographics to focus on when leveling the playing field, but they are only two. People often forget about other variables like age, educational background, military service, physical ability, and work history. Hiring diverse talent means more than splitting your team 50/50 and calling it a day; it means introducing and empowering as many divergent identities, experiences, and perspectives as possible.\\nWhat does it look like?\\nTake a minute to reflect on your own team. How many non-male individuals are there? How many non-white and non-male individuals work on your team? Do you work alongside any military veterans? Have you interviewed any LGBTQIA, alternative education, or disabled individuals?

He made the move from San Antonio to Plano and has been working there ever since. With our recent expansion to Dallas and a successful 4-year employment, we were curious: Was attending and hiring from Codeup worth it? We interviewed him and his boss so you can learn !\\nSo Stan, why did you decide to attend Codeup instead of going another route?\\nStan: I was living in San Antonio at the time and looking for a way to refresh my skills and become more marketable in the IT sector after working overseas for a long time. Codeup was the most attractive option and was right in the city.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd Russell, why did you decide to hire from Codeup?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat would be your advice to a Codeup grad starting their first development job?\\nStan: Be honest with yourself about your skill set and don’t be afraid to ask questions to senior devs at the company. Even if those questions perhaps seem like things you think you should know or you think they expect you to know. Don’t let imposter syndrome get the best of you. If the company knows you came from a coding bootcamp, they should know that you are not the finished product and will require mentoring.

All of Codeup’s resources, like contacts of potential employers, and the knowledge of what the industry is looking for and overall demands that need to be met, make getting your foot in the door much easier. You get added resume prep. You’re usually also better prepared. Collaboration experience of working on a project is another advantage a Codeup grad might have over another candidate.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nRussell, same question!\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat do you think sets Codeup grads apart from Computer Science majors right out of college?\\nStan: Many Codeup grads have some sort of prior work and more life experience.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd Russell?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat has been the best part of your time at Lifeblue?\\nStan: Getting to work on a diverse and ever challenging set of projects and do it all with a truly fantastic group of people.\\n\\xa0\\nRussell, what do you think has been the best part of Stan’s time at Lifeblue?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat was the best part of your time at Codeup?\\nStan: The best part of Codeup was that it provided me with exactly what I hoped for and what Codeup said it could provide: the opportunity and means to attain a career as a web developer.\\n\\xa0\\nLooks like the Codeup investment paid off!

Only now, those that can’t afford it have to fight for scholarships and grants or bear the burden of student loan repayment for three, four, sometimes five or more decades. Thanks to student loan repayment, many feel forced to postpone life milestones, unable to finance a house or children while catching up on debt. In the midst of a pandemic, that financial strain is a risk people are more hesitant to take.\\nThe Promise Undelivered\\nWhat’s the point of college, anyhow? Why insist that everyone should go even if it causes financial strain for decades? Well, because it’s supposed to give us the education we need to be successful, prepare us for the working world, and get us to a job where we can make use of our degree right after college. For the lucky few, that actually happened. The rest didn’t get the Return on Investment they hoped for. After college, they struggled to find their way, often winding up in career paths that don’t require their degree, but all the while, continuing to pay for it. A promised not delivered? Not exactly, because there was never a legal promise, just advice from everyone around them. An unfortunate debt and learning experience? Some may call it that.\\nCollege in Decline Amid COVID-19\\nSo if not college, then what? Many are going against the grain, saving tens of thousands of dollars and years of their life in the process. Who’s profiting? Institutions that offer short-term training in a marketable skill, and their students. The pandemic has loomed upon us for about a year now, and in that year, short-term credential classes saw an enrollment spike of 8 million students, a 70% increase from just before COVID-19. Meanwhile, enrollment of freshmen in college dropped 16%. Going this route, even students are profiting, as they’re able to start earning income much faster.\\nBootcamps on the Rise\\nWhile short-term classes in more traditional trade careers, like electricians, mechanics, plumbing, and some health care professions have been around since 1879, coding bootcamps are really at the heart of this spike. They’re newer and more enticing to the emerging adults of Gen Z. They help millennials right the wrongs of their post-grad plans not working out. Even older generations are seeing the shift to a technical world and want in.\\n\\xa0\\nOur aim here at Codeup is to develop the workforce, our mission to empower life change. While we can’t speak to any other coding schools’ mission, their aim is more or less the same. College provides a place to learn while coding bootcamps and trade schools provide a clear path into a career. College provides an often broad and philosophical education, covering a wide array of topics like history, science, and liberal arts, with a focus on whatever we are interested in. Coding bootcamps and trade schools prepare you for one thing and one thing only, with a focus on in-demand careers. It’s everything you need to know, and nothing you don’t.\\nCurrently in college and feeling stuck? Transition out with Codeup, where you can start your career 10X faster!

       " {'title': 'Why Should You Become a Web Developer?',\n",
       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/web-development/why-should-you-become-a-web-developer/',\n",
       "  'content': 'There are some things we all look for in a career. Job security, good compensation, work/life balance, personal fulfillment – all of these can be found in a career as a developer! There’s lots of demand for them, but not nearly enough of them. Despite stereotypes, web developers can actually find their work very engaging and personally rewarding, and the world certainly needs them. It’s a solid career path, with room for growth – both personal and professional. Keep reading to learn why you should become a web developer!\\n\\xa0\\nDemand is High\\nThe demand for web developers is ever increasing. There are currently about 1,504,895 developer jobs, and 250,000 of them remain open. The 10-year growth predicted in 2019 was 8%, a rate that’s much faster than the average for all occupations. But the talent pool isn’t keeping up. In fact, Codeup was founded in 2013 by employers that couldn’t find the talent they needed to fill their development roles. This significant gap between supply and demand is a constant stretching from Silicon Valley to New York City, and probably further.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhy so much demand?\\nFor anything you need or need to know, your first touchpoint is the internet. We’ve ditched physical dictionaries and encyclopedias in favor of a Google search. Friendships and networking now exist online, and the activity of “going shopping” has been replaced with e-commerce for everything from electronics, to clothing, to education, even groceries (HEB has been dethroned by Amazon). This stark technical shift isn’t going to go away, especially now that companies have been forced to adapt to doing business online. Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat.\\xa0\\nWhile traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won’t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career!\\n\\xa0\\nA Solid, Secure Career Path\\nReason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you’ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It’s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That’s true whether you’re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you’re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless.\\n\\xa0\\nGreat Compensation and Benefits\\nIt’s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are:\\n\\nNationwide: $43,297 (ZipRecruiter)\\xa0\\nTexas: $40,463 (ZipRecruiter)\\xa0\\nSan Antonio: $38,650 (ZipRecruiter)\\nCodeup graduates: $45,505 (CIRR)\\n\\nThose are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass “entry level.” Average salaries are:\\n\\nAll Web Developers: Nationwide: $75,073 | San Antonio: $67,709 (ZipRecruiter)\\nSenior Web Developers: Nationwide: $104,827 | San Antonio: $94,544 (ZipRecruiter)\\n\\nSenior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there’s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come!\\n\\xa0\\nContinuous Learning and Growth\\nLook, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution:\\n\\n\\xa0With a heavy focus on pair programming, you’ll need to get used to reviewing other people’s code. That just makes you a more patient and better communicator!\\xa0\\nWith different deliverables requiring different programming languages and new ones becoming widespread, you’ll need to keep up and stay sharp to stay relevant.\\xa0\\nAnd let’s be clear, developers don’t just hide behind their computers all day. They need great communication skills to collaborate with people who need things to look a certain way by a certain deadline. You’ll frequently collaborate with other developers, other departments, and sometimes, external clients.\\n\\nThis career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth.\\n\\xa0\\nJob Satisfaction\\nJob satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You’ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs. (That’s much higher than the national average of 51%!)\\n\\xa0\\nPersonal Fulfillment\\nLots of developers think of their job as a hobby, like mastering an instrument or a sport. It can be very personally fulfilling. For some, they’re creative and innovative. They enjoy being at the forefront of tech and bringing ideas to life. It’s an exciting place to be! Others fully embrace their analytical skills, and love the idea of seeing performance results whenever they run their code. If it runs, fabulous. If it doesn’t, it’s a problem they enjoy solving. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. Is it also very rewarding when it finally works the way they intend? Absolutely. Thinking more externally, can the applications you make truly make a difference in someone’s life? Definitely! When you’re a web developer working with the right team toward the right mission, you might love it so much you’d do it for free (hypothetically, of course).\\n\\xa0\\nSo  It’s a solid career path with high compensation and high demand that will grant you the stability, security, and confidence we all long for. Going one step further, you can meet your full potential in a position with constant growth and high job satisfaction, where creative minds can embrace their creativity and analytical minds can embrace their problem-solving skills. Feel fulfilled, confident, accomplished, and secure. Start today, be a web developer in 6 months! Apply now! Future you will thank you.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Is your degree not getting you the job prospects you hoped for? Having doubts about college? Accidentally study Wizardry for four years? We have heard many stories about degrees that didn’t pan out long term. At our event “,” Codeup Data Science alumni Nicole Garza and Jesse Ruiz were living proof that your degree doesn’t have to box you in. Our Director of Marketing and Admissions, who studied Health and Exercise Science, led a discussion on how their seemingly non-relevant degrees got them to where they are now. Keep reading to see how Jesse went from Ivy League graduate to Codeup alumna, and how Nicole went from interning for the mayor to building up a data science department.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhat did you get your degree in?\\nNicole: My name is Nicole and I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in Sociology.\\nJesse: I’m Jesse. I have an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, then studied Fine Arts in graduate school.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat did you do after getting a degree, and what made you realize it wasn’t for you?\\nNicole: I interned for the mayor’s office, but you need a certain personality type to do politics. I’d rather be behind a screen.\\nJesse: I was an artist and taught art. It was a really fun and amazing opportunity but it wasn’t financially secure.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhy pursue a career in tech?\\nNicole: I did some jobs where I had to work with data, descriptive statistics, and a database. Then I got interested in pursuing that at a higher level.\\nJesse: With my degree in Philosophy at an Ivy League, I got lots of training in analytical thinking and study habits. I did well in calculus and physics, and being an artist took a huge amount of self-discipline and creativity. I see all of those things largely in data science.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat helped you know if data science was the career path for you?\\nNicole: Both my brothers are developers, and software developers are a great resource to help understand the coding part of data science. Some courses in my undergrad had a heavy emphasis on research, data, and statistical analysis and I remembered that I enjoyed those.\\nJesse: I started searching for other career opportunities and took a lot of quizzes about what the best career is for your personality. I did a lot of research in the field and consulted my cousin who is a software developer. It took me about a year of part-time self-teaching for me to actually understand the field.\\n\\xa0\\nHow would you recommend for someone else to decide on a career path in tech?\\nNicole: Take a short online class to see if it’s something you’d perhaps enjoy. Something very simple and basic. Talk to people in the field. Think about past courses or experiences that you enjoyed or were good at.\\xa0\\nJesse: Take a predetermined period of time taking some courses and harnessing your network. Talk to your cousin that’s in the field, or the career services at your alma mater to think through your options with someone else.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat made you want to quit your job and go all in?\\nNicole: The job I was at before Codeup wasn’t for me. It was very repetitive and I wanted something different, more creative, something that would get the wheels of my mind turning. I started researching options and wanted something that started at a beginner level. Then shortly after, Codeup announced their new data science program. I did some research on it, took the tests and the rest is history!\\nJesse: It takes a leap of faith. At the time, I was going through some health issues. I was worried about not having health insurance and living at home with my mom and barely making enough money. Codeup has done a great job of helping students work through even the really serious aspects of the decision-making process. I gave myself a year of researching and studying, and then I got funding. When I got funding there was no turning back, I was gonna do this. I think about if I would have done the program if I didn’t have funding, probably. The cost is scary. But if you spend enough time thinking about it, considering the field, and introspecting about where you want your personal life to go, I think that’s what it takes\\n\\xa0\\nWhen you actually started working as Data Scientists, did you ever feel like you weren’t “good enough?”\\nNicole: When I first started at the company I’m at now, they were just using Excel to do everything and used zero coding. So, I came in and they really relied on me to help innovate and change things. I started changing a lot of the processes from Excel over to Python and R but I was afraid that I was not doing things correctly because I was new to the field. I was scared I was kind of leading the company in the wrong direction or something. But I double, triple checked everything I did and made sure it’s right. Now, we’ve been growing and the company has more than doubled in size!\\nJesse: Finding a job afterward is very stressful and uncertain. Once you start working, you kind of go back to lots of learning and adjusting. Sometimes in my new team that I’m on, I feel like there are moments I don’t really know what I’m doing. But it’s obvious to me that no one knows everything, and I can know things that more experienced or senior people might not know and that’s okay. So no, I haven’t experienced it that much.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd finally, what are you doing now?\\nNicole: I work at Guardian Premier Solutions. I think they found me through the Codeup Alumni Portal and contacted me. We interviewed for 30 minutes, and within one week they asked when I can start. We monitor psychological and physiological data through devices and tests to determine the best type of military training candidate. That’s something I’ve really been enjoying, and I really enjoy my coworkers as well. They really value input and new ideas, and I love that. Really grateful for this job, it’s been really great. Thanks, Codeup!\\xa0\\nJesse: Initially out of Codeup, I worked with a small boutique consulting firm, I was a contractor developing Excel macros. I was there short term and then got a job at USAA, also as a contractor. I was working on a team that was doing some design work and making presentations. Then, I transferred to a team that did data reporting, then to a team that did machine learning. I became a full-time employee and now get benefits. Honestly, everything’s been great and I’ve achieved everything I wanted to out of Codeup, which includes moving out of my mom’s house! I’m living a more stable life now. Overall, it’s been really great.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHopefully, these stories serve as inspiration to not put yourself in a box simply based on your degree! The tech field is welcoming to anyone that can learn the skills, no matter their educational background. If you’ve been wanting to pivot to a different field than what your degree is in, Codeup is the perfect place to start! Learn more about which of our programs is best for you here.'},\n",

The Annie Easley scholarship is a $1000 scholarship awarded to every Codeup student who identifies as Black or African-American. Read on to learn about our commitment to diversifying tech, our support of the Black community, and Annie Easley!\\nWhy the new scholarship?\\n\\n\\xa0\\nOur Core Value of Cultivating Inclusive Growth\\nWe make an active, ongoing effort to cultivate inclusive growth at Codeup and in the tech field at large. By encouraging diversity in our cohorts, we are contributing to the long-term growth of underrepresented groups in tech when our students join the workforce. We offer need-based Pride, Veteran, Minorities in Tech, and Women in Tech scholarships. While the numbers of female, non-Black minority, and LGBTQIA+ developers are growing, they are still outpacing their Black counterparts. To help support the growth of the Black community in tech, our Annie Easley scholarship is a guaranteed $1,000 to every student who applies for the scholarship and identifies as Black and/or African-American.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nRepresentation Matters\\nIn 2018, only 2.7% of professional developers identified as Black. In two years, that number grew by less than 1%. In 2020, only 3.6% of professional developers identify as Black, even though the overall population is 13.4% Black. For some context, 70.7% of developers identify as white.\\nWhy do we care? The people building technology should represent the people using technology, and we need to do more to make that happen. Empowering underrepresented developers can increase career opportunities, normalize this career path for rising professionals, and yield more inclusive and equitable technology solutions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCodeup recognizes that there are structural barriers to entry into tech due to systemic racism\\nThe centuries of racism and the ensuing, long-lasting burdens on the African-American population cannot be undone.\\xa0 We acknowledge that there are built-in hurdles that Black Americans have to overcome that are based on thoughts and ideals resulting from that racism. What we can do is work to level the playing field by softening the financial barrier to entry into tech. Our hope is that a guaranteed scholarship will help facilitate this and open up opportunities.\\n\\xa0\\nWho is Annie Easley?\\nAnnie Easley was one of the first Black employees at NACA (now NASA), where she worked as a human-computer, computer engineer, and rocket scientist from 1955-1989. She wrote the code for the computer program that controls the fuel mixture of the Centaur rocket, which went on to successfully launch several space probes and is still being used today. Additionally, her work on energy conversion systems and alternative energy technology was used to develop the batteries used in modern hybrid vehicles. Easley has also co-authored several papers on nuclear power plants and rocket science.\\nIn 1977, she went back to school to get a degree in Mathematics while working full-time, where she raised awareness about NASA and inspired many women and minorities to pursue STEM careers. Later in her career, she helped supervisors address discrimination complaints as an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, and fought for women’s rights.\\xa0\\nModern spaceflight likely wouldn’t be possible without her, and much of what we know about space might still be unknown. Her work has been monumental not only for African-Americans, not only for women, not only for programmers, but for technology as we know it. That is why we’re naming this scholarship and our next Data Science cohort after her.\\n\\xa0\\nHave a say in tomorrow’s tech\\nThe technology of tomorrow starts today. If you identify as Black or African-American and would like to help build future technology, start a career as a software developer or data scientist! \\nClick here to apply for Codeup, and here to apply for the Easley Scholarship.\\n\\xa0\\nAND a special shout out to Shawn Erwin for helping to bring this scholarship to life with the art featured on the image above!'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Setting Expectations for Life Before, During, and After Codeup\\nHave you been wondering about whether or not you can keep your current job during Codeup, or if Codeup classes will let you work around certain hours of certain days, or if you really have to apply so far in advance? We get questions like this all the time from prospective students. To make sure you’re successful in your career transition, let’s first set up some expectations about what you can expect before, during, and after Codeup. What is it like to experience life at a coding bootcamp?\\n\\xa0\\nBefore Codeup\\n\\n\\xa0\\nDo the Prework\\nThe number one, most important, most helpful advice we can give is: do the prework! Give yourself a month to carefully understand and complete the prework we assign when you’re accepted, which was made to help you practice active learning and problem-solving. You’ll soon find that programming is all about practice and getting that muscle memory, like learning to play an instrument. You will thank yourself if you finish it, and risk falling behind if you don’t.\\nApply Early\\nIn order to complete the prework, you’ll need to apply early. Why? Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You’ll need to be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework. The multi-step application process can take several weeks to over a month. Combining the prework timeframe plus the application timeframe means you should apply seven weeks before your start date. This will also give you enough time to secure grant funding, if applicable, as that also takes about a month to be processed. You can learn more about our application process here.\\xa0\\n\\nDuring Codeup\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUnderstand Your New Schedule\\nCodeup classes are full-time, immersive experiences. As a Codeup student, these are the times you will need to be in class:\\n\\n\\nMonday-Friday: 9am-5pm*^\\n*Early release every Monday OR Tuesday: 9am-4pm\\n^Half-day every Wednesday: 9am-12:30pm\\n\\n\\xa0\\nClasses are being conducted daily via live Zoom calls with instructors and other classmates. Optional office hours are held before and after class for additional help. You should plan to spend 20-25 additional hours per week practicing what you learned in class. You should also arrive at your workstation with coffee in tow 30 minutes before class starts so that you can map out your schedule for the day, and review what questions you have going into lecture. Combining office hours, planning, and practicing, you can expect to be occupied from 8am to 7 or 8pm almost daily.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLimit Outside Distractions As Much As Possible\\nNow that you know your new schedule, you can probably see that you won’t have time for much else. Just for a few months, you’ll have to do the bare minimum outside of Codeup.\\xa0\\nYou will need to quit your job. Before joining Codeup, try to save enough money to pay your bills for 6 months. We strongly suggest you avoid working outside of class, as this typically results in poor classroom performance, and we really want you to do well. If you have to work, calculate the bare minimum you need to earn each week in order to get by. Then, spread out your workload to do a little bit here and there throughout the week rather than full days on the weekends, because you do need rest days! The best options are flexible jobs where you’re in charge of your own schedule, such as food delivery, rideshare, dog walking, babysitting, etc. This is not the time to take an overnight shift at your current job or start your own business.\\nYou may need to downgrade your living situation to save up. Some students have sold their houses to make this investment possible. Some have moved in with in-laws to save on bills. Some have had to find roommates. Do whatever you can, within reason, to not have to work during Codeup!\\nYou won’t be able to adopt puppies, but you can get a fish, try raising plants, or look at pictures of puppies until you can get the real thing after you graduate! The last option is great because you’ll have a reward to work towards, but you have to earn it!\\nOutside classes are also a no-go, but you can watch YouTube videos and documentaries on a new subject you’re interested in.\\xa0\\nFamily and friends may not get to see you as much, but every weekend you can tell them all about what you’re learning and appreciate the time together that much more!\\nRemember, it’s only 6 months of complete dedication to changing your life at a coding bootamp, and then you’ll be thanking yourself for the sacrifices you made!\\n\\nTake Notes the Right Way\\xa0\\nGone are the days of copying lecture notes word-for-word. (Did that ever work, anyway?) Since you’ll have an online curriculum to read through and refer back to, write notes on what you don’t understand during reading, practice, or lecture. It’s good to track what exactly doesn’t make sense and what you’ve tried that didn’t work so you can ask more targeted questions, whether to peers, Google, or instructors. This way, you’re building yourself a roadmap to follow when you return to your studies each day.\\n\\nStudy = Practice\\nLearning how to code is like learning an instrument. Practice, practice, practice. You can do all the reading you want, watch all the video tutorials, and still not know how to code if you don’t actually code. There’s no cramming for exams, no writing research papers. It’s continuous learning and adding to your arsenal through a few additional hours of study/practice every day.\\n\\nNetwork\\nIn order to make the most of your experience, build on skills, and help yourself for the job search in the long run, you’ll be encouraged to attend meetups, join community Slack channels, and try to meet others in the industry to build your support network, so you have plenty of people to ask for help. You don’t have to go through this alone!\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAfter Codeup\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGit Push Everyday\\xa0\\nWhile this sounds totally foreign right now, it will become a daily mantra! Every Codeup student will make an account on a website called GitHub. On a daily basis, we’ll expect you to “commit” code, which means to make a revision to a code file, and then “push” that revision, which, in this case, means to transfer it from your computer to GitHub so that others can keep track of how often you’re coding. This is important to keep up after graduating Codeup to keep your coding skills fresh, and so that potential employers can see that you’re actively working on your craft.\\n\\nKeep Learning\\nEvery day between graduation and the start of your job, you should become more valuable and skilled, not less polished and more rusty. The learning never stops, especially not in tech, and especially not in data science! What’s all the rage one year may be out of date the next, and it’s your responsibility to stay on top of the latest technology, programming languages, and practices.\\n\\nYour Job Search is Your New Full-Time Job\\nWe have a whole team dedicated to helping students get jobs! Our placement team will assist you even after graduating. You’ll spend time every day on either finding new listings, touching up your resume and LinkedIn, applying, or interviewing…and that’s in addition to coding every day. You gotta put in the work to find work. Do be prepared to get rejected sometimes, but trust the process. It’s much better to face these mass unemployment rates with a whole team working to get you hired rather than on your own.\\nIn summary, you get out what you put in. Our most successful students finished their pre work and made significant life sacrifices to stay focused and committed to the program. Others that weren’t ready, willing, or able to make the changes they needed were unfortunately not able to finish. However, those that do continue to reap the rewards!

       " {'title': 'What is Codeup’s Application Process?',\n",
       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/codeup-application-process/',\n",
       "  'content': 'Curious about the application process? Wondering why you need to apply so far in advance? You’ve come to the right blog post! From pre-work to technical assessments, to financial aid and interviews, there are a number of reasons you need to apply 1-2 months ahead of your start date. To explain Codeup’s application process, let’s start by working backward.\\n\\xa0\\nWeb Development & Data Science\\nNote: The tilde (squiggly) means “approximately”.\\n\\xa0\\nPre-work (~1 month)\\nAfter being accepted, every incoming student is given a set of pre-work to do to familiarize themselves with some coding basics. You won’t be expected to have everything memorized, but some exposure will be required for you to hit the ground running on your first week of class. Many have likened our bootcamp to drinking out of a firehose- there’s a lot of ground to cover in 5 months! Completing the pre-work is the best gift you can give yourself in order to soften the blow. Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You should be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTuition Planning (~1 month, concurrent with pre-work)\\nOnce you’re accepted, you’ll meet with our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager to discuss your financial aid options. She’s also Codeup’s School Certifying Official for VA Benefits, which take roughly 2 weeks to be processed. Scholarships are awarded about 2 weeks before the first class day, so you will need to have applied for any scholarships before then. Grants can range from 2-8 weeks to be processed and secured, but usually take about a month. You will need to be accepted before applying for grants. The tuition process is finalized in the month leading up to the start date, while you’re also working on prework.\\n\\xa0\\nBehavioral Interview (~30 min)\\nThink of this as a casual job interview. We want to make sure you are culturally and behaviorally cut out for Codeup. The intensity and rigor is not for everyone. In this step of the application process, we’re looking for motivated, positive, hard-working, and dedicated character traits. Bonus points if you read our blog post about tips for nailing a video interview!\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTechnical Assessments (~1-2 weeks for Web Development, ~1-4 weeks for Data Science)\\nFor Web Development, we will give a couple of technical assessments to test your problem-solving skills. They are not necessarily pass/fail tests, but rather, they help us see how we can best prepare you for class. Those who do not do well on the first challenge have additional opportunities to develop their problem-solving skills. We want to be sure you are set up for success in class!\\xa0\\nFor Data Science, the technical assessments may take much longer as there are more prerequisites, but it varies from person to person. We require a basic level of Python, math, and stats prior to being accepted. How well versed you are in those subjects determines how long this process takes. Could be a week if you were a math major in college, could be months if you’ve never heard of Applied Statistics. Plenty of our students knew nothing about stats or Python before applying but worked through our recommended resources (tutorials and workshops) in order to get to the level they need to be on. Don’t count yourself out! But do be realistic about how long it will take you to learn. If you were to apply for our Data Science program a couple weeks before class starts, knowing nothing about Python or stats, our Admissions Manager will be happy to provide all the necessary resources you need for a future start date, but you may not be qualified in time for the next class start, considering you’d also have to finish pre-work in that limited time.\\xa0\\nFor both programs, we have weekly study sessions with our Teaching Assistants to help you with any material that’s causing you trouble!\\n\\xa0\\nCampus Visit (~1 hour, same week as application)\\nWe may be virtual right now, but we’re still doing virtual campus visits! You can think of this as a program overview. We’ll discuss the admissions process, the curriculum, the schedule, how things are looking now that we’re remote, and any questions you might have.\\n\\xa0\\nPhone Call (~15-30 minutes, same week as application)\\nYou can think of this as an initial admissions consultation or phone interview, but really we’re just making sure it’s the right fit! Some people think applying for Codeup means getting paid to learn to code, some people think we teach medical coding. This call is just to introduce ourselves, make sure you’re crystal clear on what Codeup is (a full-time career accelerator that trains and places data scientists and software developers), and to answer any questions you might have.\\n\\xa0\\nApplication (<5 minutes)\\nThe first step in your\\xa0application process is your application! It’s basically just sending us your name and contact info so we can get the ball rolling on making you a Data Scientist or Software Developer! How exciting!\\nNow, are you pumped to begin your own application process and experience all this in action? You can fill out your super quick application here. Our (helpful and friendly) Admissions team will be in touch ASAP to help you change careers. Even if you’re not sure if Codeup is right for you, we can help you work through your doubts and hesitancies in your initial phone call. \\n\\xa0\\nWith an Admissions Manager as your guide, our Teaching Assistants as your personal tutors, and our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager as your tuition planning assistant, you’ll never have to go at this alone!

       "  'content': 'Alumni Katy Salts and Brandi Reger joined us at a public panel event to discuss their Transition into Data Science! Keep reading to hear what stands out to them about Codeup, how Codeup helped them launch a career in data science, and what they are up to now.\\nThe Panelists\\nKaty Salts graduated from Codeup’s first Data Science cohort back in June of 2019. She has since started working as a Data Scientist at Cyber Fortress, where she has been for about a year. Prior to joining Codeup, Katy studied and worked in biology.\\xa0\\nBrandi Reger graduated from Codeup in July of 2020 with our third Data Science cohort. She has since been hired as a Data Engineer at HEB. Prior to joining Codeup, Brandi had just gotten a degree in Geology in pursuit of becoming an Archeologist after serving in the Army for 5 years. She minored in Statistics, which she wanted to pursue further after realizing archeology wasn’t for her.\\nWhy did you choose Codeup over other routes?\\n“I didn’t have the ability to take off work and pursue a Masters Degree for 2 years or an undergrad degree for 4 years, and this was the perfect crash course. Also the cost is a lot cheaper than graduate programs and I got a lot of help with grants and scholarships.” – Katy\\nWhat sets Codeup’s curriculum apart?\\n“It’s very applied. You put what you learn into use and you learn why you learned it that way. In collegiate, you’ll take a test but it’s not quite the same thing as getting your hands dirty and figuring it out. Your mind can drift during lecture and you don’t really “get” it until you do a project. But since you’re doing a project on almost every topic at Codeup, that really solidified the topics we were learning for me.” – Brandi\\nHow much programming did you know coming into Codeup?\\n“I could not name one programming language. I didn’t know anything. The prework was the first time I wrote a line of code. With Codeup, they will start you from the very beginning of learning programming, it’s just fast-paced.” – Katy\\nHow did you address fears or doubt about whether or not you can do it?\\n“Just get your hands dirty and do it! Once you’re working on it, it turns out it’s not as bad or as hard as you thought it was. Because you don’t know it, it seems like this amazing, glorious thing in the sky but when you actually work on it you’re like ‘oh, it was just that, that’s no big deal.’ All you have to do is try and apply yourself and you’ll figure it out.” – Brandi\\nWhat was one of your favorite lessons?\\n“The first project we had, our instructor had to go away for the weekend so we couldn’t contact her. The whole class collectively could not come up with an answer to the problem. We were freaking out thinking like ‘We did something wrong. Why can we not figure it out? She left us!’ We were so scared. When she came back she said ‘you learned a really important lesson, and that’s that sometimes there is no answer to the question. You just need to be able to look at the data and take it for what it is.’ You can’t make things up based on the data you find. You have to come up with real conclusions. That one hit me pretty hard and I never forgot it.” – Katy\\nWhat advice would you give to someone in the admissions process?\\n“The prework is the best thing you can do for yourself coming into the program. We didn’t go in knowing everything and memorizing it all, and they didn’t expect us to either. You just have to know basic concepts. Like understand that there’s a way to do something and maybe not necessarily know how yet but know that there’s a way. So just being exposed to it ahead of time is helpful.” – Katy\\nBrandi, you had the unique experience of being in-person and virtual. What was that like?\\n“I really liked being remote. Being in class, it was distracting. My classmates, we were best friends basically while we were going through the program. So we were constantly chatting and everything. But once it was remote it was all quiet. There was nobody distracting me, and I could focus on what I was doing.We could still chat when I wanted to but I could turn off chat when I needed to. Also when the teachers were talking, I had my dual monitors, so I was able to look up what they were talking about and it really solidified what I was learning. So, I got a lot out of it.” – Brandi\\nHow was your experience with our student placement team?\\n“They are not messing around! I mean, they start early and they leave no stone unturned! They come in and they’re completely revamping your Linkedin, email, photos, what you should and should not post. One-on-one meetings about what you’re looking for in a company and how they can help you get there, what connections they have, who to talk to, who to connect with. How to answer phone calls. Interview questions in class, like answering them together, answering them one-on-one. Mock interviews, resume building. Beginning to end, I mean, that alone was worth it to go through Codeup because no other place gives you that much attention on one single student, and everybody got that attention, and everybody got jobs! And that’s because of all the work they put into getting you ready not just technically, but professionally. They will get you there if you just listen to them and don’t fight back, don’t argue. Just do what they’re saying because they’ve done this enough times and they know what works. Just trust them.” – Katy\\nWhat does working in the field look like?\\xa0\\n“My job is awesome! I get to work from home. It’s definitely constant learning. I think Codeup really prepared me for that because they didn’t just teach me how to code- they taught me how to learn and how to learn quickly. I carried that into my job and my job taught me not only to code but also to be able to apply that to a business model. Learning doesn’t stop after Codeup.” – Katy\\nWhat’s a typical day in the life for you?\\n“I just started a couple of weeks ago so right now a day in the life is reading things and trying to figure out what they are. There are multiple data engineering teams so we all get together and talk about the projects we’re working on and new projects coming down the line. Or we’ll talk to the Data Scientists and they’ll tell us how they’re using our products and what they need from us, and we get to see what happens with the data we’re cleaning and putting together. It’s a constant moving forward and checking in with each other. At this job, you use every programming language you learn at Codeup and 10 others that I don’t even know yet. Everything you learn is useful for something. Codeup teaching you how to learn is very useful because there are still a lot of things I need to learn now.” – Brandi\\nWhat distinguishes a Data Engineer from a Data Scientist?\\n“As a Data Engineer, I clean up the data and put it together in a way that makes sense. We take the data in a nasty, messy state, it’s all over the place, and make it nice and neat so that somebody else can figure something out from it.” – Brandi\\nIs there anything that surprised you in terms of what was considered “data science” during your job search?\\n\\xa0“You have to think of data science as a spectrum of things and on that spectrum you can specialize in different areas, like just gathering data, or just cleaning, just modeling, just making presentations or dashboards. A lot of businesses don’t know what they actually need. They’ll say they need one thing but really what they’re asking for is something else. So you need to be able to sort through those and ask clear questions in interviews. That was a tough lesson to learn in the job search.” -Katy\\n\\xa0\\nMore personal quotes include Katy saying that this was “the best thing I’ve done” and Brandi saying that the experience “made me a better person.” Thank you both for joining us!

While many positions in data science work across the entire data science pipeline, some are more active in a particular area. Codeup prepares you to take any number of data science career paths throughout this pipeline. To help explain the differences, we’ll discuss where some of our alumni have ended up. Keep reading to see what appeals to you!\\nData: Plan and Acquire\\nFirst up is the data portion of the data science pipeline, where we plan and acquire the data.\\xa0\\nBusiness Analysts like Jesse Ruiz and Jeff Hutchins, as well as People Analytics Specialists like Tim Sotirhos help their companies or departments identify what questions need to be answered, and what data they need to answer those questions. This often involves researching or reviewing existing processes and strategizing how they can be improved. They may work closely with project managers to create an action plan.\\nInformation: Process and Prepare\\nThen, in the information portion, we process and prepare the data for future exploration.\\nData Analysts like Matthew Zapata aggregate and manage, that is, combine, process, prepare, and store, the data for easy access. They research and improve on data quality and safeguard against data loss or errors. They also explore the data for potential relationships between variables, usefulness, and outliers. Data Analysts may also acquire the data and/or analyze the data for potential insights, but typically do not build and deploy machine learning models.\\nKnowledge: Explore and Analyze\\nIn the knowledge portion, data is analyzed and turned into meaningful statistics\\nThis stage is typically combined with Information or Intelligence rather than existing on its own. In a given company, their Data Analysts may both prepare and explore data, or the Machine Learning Engineers will both explore and model the data. Data Scientists, the broadest career in data science, typically will do all three, like Ednalyn De Dios. Unlike other data professionals (unless otherwise trained), Data Scientists can work anywhere along this continuum.\\xa0\\nIntelligence: Model\\nOnce we have that knowledge, we use the intelligence stage to turn it into future predictions with machine learning models.\\nWhen the data is ready, Machine Learning Engineers like Michael Moran and Eric Escalante write the algorithms necessary to build, deploy, and continue to improve upon machine learning models. A machine learning model is a file that uses an algorithm to identify patterns and trends from data.\\nDecision Science Analysts, like Jeff Roeder, use math, stats, and machine learning models to convert intelligence-driven insights to actionable recommendations. They answer the questions asked by Business Analysts earlier in the timeline to draw conclusions for their company.\\nAction: Delivery\\nFinally, the action stage lets us integrate these insights into tests, then continue to monitor and evaluate new data.\\nSecurity Data Analysts like Sara Pena need to be able to identify trends from automated models that they or someone else created. They meet with stakeholders to discuss their analysis and help develop tests and prototypes of their recommendations. They then own and execute projects related to continuous improvement of their company’s processes.\\n\\nWhere Do You Fit In?\\nIt’s totally possible for YOU to take on any of these job titles! Maybe it’s time to explore these careers even further, especially if one excited you. While Codeup does prepare and train Data Scientists, you may find your niche and prefer one stage to another. Whatever you choose, Codeup will help you land the job you want not only with our expert, employer-driven curriculum but also with professional help and placement services.

       "  'content': 'If you’ve been digging around our website or researching tech tools, you may have heard of Python. Python is a programming language that can be used by software developers, accountants, mathematicians, and especially, data scientists. Python is actually the dominant programming language in data science, often used for data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.\\nWhat is Python Used For?\\nPython is an object-oriented language, meaning that the focus is on data and procedures rather than functions and logic. By writing out procedures, you can actually modify the data you have. It can help you automate mundane, repetitive tasks, such as downloading websites, changing the format of those websites, renaming those files, and uploading them to servers. With Python, you can program all of these tasks to be done automatically every time you download a website. This automation saves data scientists a lot of time.\\xa0\\nIs it Good for Beginners?\\nYes! One of the key features of Python is the short, easy to understand syntax in which you write your code. Its minimalistic nature allows you to focus on solving your problem rather than solving the code itself. It reads and feels more like English as compared to other common programming languages. Sometimes, what would take you 4 lines of code in Java can be done with 1 line of code in Python. Because it is a high-level language, meaning it is largely independent of your computer specifications, you can get started using Python on whatever device you have – even phones, tablets, or PlayStation!\\nHow is it Used in Data Science?\\nPython can be used for data wrangling, data analysis, data visualizations, and applying machine learning algorithms. Data wrangling involves preparing raw data for use by parsing it, meaning to convert each data point to a standard format, and by cleaning it, which means to separate useful data from erroneous or missing data points. This is relatively easy if you have only a few data points, but parsing Big Data by hand, like a thousands-of-terabytes large list of every transaction a retail store has ever had, is out of the question. So, Python is used to automate these tasks. It’s also used for data analysis – helping you find trends, correlations, variations, and outliers; data visualizations – helping you chart or graph your findings to show to others; and machine learning, as the complex algorithms and workflows that it’s capable of make it great for Artificial Intelligence.\\nWhile this all sounds quite complex, remember, every data scientist started out knowing nothing about Python.

       "  'content': 'There’s a lot we can learn about machines, and there’s a lot machines can learn about us, too! Ever wonder how virtual personal assistants or dating apps work? Or how Netflix picks the perfect show for you? They’re learning from you by optimizing and building upon human-created algorithms. Each text you type, person you swipe, or show you pick is stored as data, and through a process called machine learning, that data is plugged into algorithms to streamline your next texting, dating, or show-picking experience.\\n“Shows You Might Like”\\nLet’s take any entertainment streaming service. It stores information about the titles you’ve watched, like genre, actors, year, category, and how (if) you rated them, in order to recommend other titles you may also enjoy. It also considers what other titles members with similar preferences have enjoyed. All of this data is stored and used as input in algorithms, which are sets of rules that solve a problem. The problem, in this case, is that you might like to have a new show to watch.\\nAs you continue interacting with your entertainment streaming service, the better the recommendations will be, because the more data it has on what you choose to watch.\\xa0\\nIs the machine really learning?\\nYes! Well, it’s learning what humans tell it to learn. The same way we might read through a book given to us to study and memorize course material, the computer gathers and stores the data we tell it to store. However, we can choose to go beyond that book and learn from other sources by running an internet search or asking others. The machine lacks the intelligence to do this on its own, but if it was programmed to do so by a human, it could.\\nSo, \\nWikipedia defines machine learning as “the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.” The key word here is “automatically.” A human manually sets up an algorithm that the machine uses to come to conclusions, but the more data the machine has, the more it has to “learn” from to improve its conclusions, without the need for a human programmer. However, the machine is only improving upon the algorithm, optimizing the output it gives with the more data it has, and not creating its own algorithms. Humans will always be needed to tell the machines what to do.\\nWant to teach a machine how to learn?\\nIf this sounds cool to you, have you ever considered a career in data science? There are a number of fascinating things to learn about data science and machine learning, and the best way to learn is with hands-on experience through numerous projects and fully-immersive learning.

       "  'content': 'Bryan Walsh, Codeup Web Development alum, and Misty Garcia, a Codeup Data Science alum, joined Sarah Mellor, Director of Marketing & Admissions, and Stephen Salas, VP of Business Development, in a virtual Zoom event to offer you their insights into building a career in tech. If you’re interested in becoming a Lead Software Developer for a government contractor, like Bryan, or having Misty’s title of Data Management Analyst for a healthcare tech company, keep reading (and watching!) to see how they made that possible.\\nWhat were you doing before Codeup?\\nBoth panelists were established in their positions before finding Codeup. Misty had been an electrical engineer for 11 years, while Bryan worked in hospitality for 14 years. Both hungry for a change, Bryan found San Antonio before finding Codeup. While answering customer questions about why an application wasn’t working the way it should, Bryan wanted to fix the problems, so he figured out a way to make that his job. Misty, however, first found data science before finding Codeup. Below, Misty discusses what stood out to her about Codeup.\\n\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Before-Codeup.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if you’re torn between data science and web development?\\nBoth panelists knew exactly which program they wanted to apply for prior to even finding Codeup, but that isn’t always the case. So, if you’re torn, there are a number of things we’ll help you think about. What are your interests? What is your background in? What are you expected to know before applying vs. before starting? What is your desired timeline? It will really help to talk this out with your admissions manager rather than on your own because you share a common goal, which is for you to succeed in the best program for you.\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Web-dev-vs-Data-science.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nThere are always new things to learn in tech. How have you learned new skills and new programming languages on the job?\\nThe most important thing you’ll learn at Codeup is how to learn. We can give you a solid foundation in skills like Python or Java, and you’ll learn very quickly. But technology is always changing, and much more important than any singule particular skill is the ability to learn. Here, Bryan hits on how Codeup prepared him to learn new skills that they weren’t explicitly taught in Codeup, but needed on the job.\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NEw-skills.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nHow did we help with your job search while in the program?\\nIn addition to our curriculum, we also train you on professional development. In the midst of changing career paths so quickly, it can be easy to doubt yourself, or to not know the industry standards and expectations regarding the job search. To help you out, each student is coached professionally, in the ways that Bryan mentions here.\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/job-search.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if you graduated but hadn’t yet gotten a job offer?\\nIn addition to professional development, we also offer job placement assistance. Not only will we help you develop the skills you need to land a job, but our Placement team goes above and beyond to actually make sure you get a job, and that by no means stops after you graduate. Misty didn’t graduate with a job lined up, but still worked closely with the Placement team until she had one.\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/no-job-offer.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nWhat would you say to someone second-guessing this career move?\\nThe field of technology is always going to change. You’ll always have to learn new things and you might start to feel like you can’t do it. But Bryan says you just gotta push through. Misty has similar advice, below. Additionally, if you feel like tech is something you can’t do, still apply for Codeup and as you move through the admissions process, allow us to work with you from where you’re at in order to get you to where you need to be. That’s what we’re here for!\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/second-guess.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nWhile building a career in tech, what sets the successful students apart?\\nBe willing! Be willing to be vulnerable, willing to admit what you don’t know, willing to work together, willing to ask for help when you need it. Instructors and admissions staff can’t help you if we don’t know that you need it. But so long as you seek out guidance, even if it means going outside of your comfort zone, we’ll make sure you succeed!\\nhttps://tribucodeup.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/successful-students.mp4\\n\\xa0\\nAnd that’s how to build a career in tech! Desire the change, believe in your capacity to do it, follow through with a willingness to learn, and soon enough, you’ll move from entry-level developer to Lead Developer, or from job seeker to helping a company build their first data science team. \\nCodeup is always ready and wanting to help along the way, it just starts with your application!'},\n",

At the 2020 CivTech Datathon, teams from two Data Science cohorts, Bayes and Curie, took 1st and 2nd place! The Codeup community is killin’ it at these events and we can’t wait to highlight their achievements!\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is CivTech Datathon?\\nCivTechSA is a partnership between Geekdom, a coworking space that every current Codeup student\\xa0has complimentary access to, and San Antonio’s Office of Innovation. In an effort to connect local communities, ideas, and data to help improve the City’s services, the CivTech Datathon competition was born! Using public datasets, competitors look for missing data and areas for improvement and identify impactful solutions to current civic problems. Then, they present their insights to City of San Antonio departments like San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and Via Metropolitan Transit.\\n\\nCodeup Alumni Take First and Second Place in 2020\\nBoasting first place was the Curie team We Came, We SAWS, We Conquered with Ryan McCall, David Wederstrandt Sr., Chase Thompson, Cameron Taylor, and Jeremy Cobb. They used data from SAWS regarding sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) events and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association to predict the root causes of SSO events. They generated a system that SAWS could use to prioritize maintenance of the sewers to limit the risk of these events, with the potential to save hundreds of millions of city dollars while keeping gastrointestinal health risks at bay.\\nTaking second place was team Get on the Bus with Sean Oslin, Sara Pena, Fredrick Lambuth, Misty Garcia, Kevin Eliasen, and Faith Kane. With their project, they aim to increase ridership of public transportation. Using open data from VIA and the Census Bureau Data API, this team identified areas of improvement to make our community more diverse and equitable by making buses more accessible.\\n\\nWe Won in 2019, Too\\nAs a special shoutout, at the 2019 CivTech Datathon, a team from our very first Data Science cohort competed and won the “Most Solvable” award. The team members were Ednalyn C. De Dios, Joseph Burton, and Sandra Graham. Their project was similar to our Curie team – they trained a model to predict which pipes would overflow.\\n\\nWant to Compete Next Year?\\nIf you’re passionate about improving civic issues and want to present your findings to city stakeholders too someday, Codeup can teach you how! You might actually inspire lasting change (or at least get thousands of dollars in prize money)! If these Codeup students could win first and second place at the datathon, what’s stopping you?

       "  'content': 'Imagine having a kit mailed to you with all the necessary components to make contaminated water clean. Cool, huh? Four of our alumni are helping to make that possible by partnering with the non-profit Elequa to design a website for their Make Water program. With this project, these Codeup alumni have the potential to make a global impact: Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller.\\xa0\\nHow Elequa is Making a Difference\\nThe Make Water program inspires, educates, and equips people that want to make a tangible difference in the world. Elequa puts together DIY kits with the tools to purify water and delivers them to people that need them, locally and abroad. This project is also given to students in the San Antonio area, who in turn are challenged to research, tweak, and further develop the kits to make them better and more accessible. These problem-solving challenges engage students in the STEM field, inspiring teamwork and collaboration while making a difference that they can be proud of: helping to provide clean water.\\nHow Codeup Alumni are Making a Difference\\nCurrently, the Make Water program lacks a platform to house and share the data gathered by students to improve the kits, while also challenging other community members for further development. They needed help with the gamification of these processes to make participation more engaging. That’s where Codeup alumni Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller came in. They are helping Elequa to build an open-source application for the Make Water program that turns community participation into a game where users can level up as they contribute and collaborate through an array of real-world challenges in water research, coding, hardware innovation, and creative storytelling.\\nDid we mention that they are working on this project as volunteers, as Codeup alumni often do? Codeup students are always looking for ways to challenge themselves, sharpen their skills, and make a difference, and that continues after graduation. To see more of the projects our students have worked on (and what you can do, too, with Codeup), check out these capstone presentations.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Everyone starts somewhere. Many developers out there didn’t grow up wanting to code. It’s something they fell into over time, much like two Codeup alumni, Bridget Mills and Eddy Bautista. These two software developers graduated from our Web Development class in December 2019. They came back for a virtual panel event to share their journey into web development and to give advice to people wanting to become a software developer.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat were you doing before Codeup?\\nEddy had been a sales assistant for years and was a student at San Antonio College studying Kinesiology.\\nBridget worked at a courthouse, but those career plans were altered after becoming a military spouse and moving. She went back to school for a degree in Information Technology (IT), specializing in System Engineering, and became an IT Specialist.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat led you to a career in coding?\\nWhen someone he knew mentioned coding, Eddy learned all he could and coded for three days using online courses and tutorials. He immediately knew this was what he wanted to do as a career.\\xa0\\nWhile Bridget was working at the lawyer’s office, a development team came in to help with court systems. She asked them questions and became fascinated by what they were doing. After deciding not to pursue law, she decided to go back to school for IT. Her job as an IT Specialist isn’t exactly what she had in mind, but her degree didn’t offer the coding experience necessary to become a developer, which was her true end goal. Even after moving to Hawaii and having two kids, that dream persisted. Her cousin, a developer, mentioned that some of her coworkers went to a coding bootcamp. With another kid and another move on the horizon, she decided she would enroll in a coding bootcamp when her family settled down in Texas.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhy Codeup for your journey into web development?\\nWhile researching how to become a developer, Eddy found Codeup. Our culture stood out to him, the admissions team was helpful, he liked that we offer help with the job search through resume assistance and interview training, and he really liked how plugged in we are to the San Antonio technology scene. He felt all the pieces coming together and could picture himself here.\\nFor Bridget, it boiled down to the curriculum and hands-on experience. When she was in college, she learned a lot of theory, but didn’t get experience actually coding, which, as she learned the hard way, is what employers are really looking for. She looked into some options for coding bootcamps and Codeup stood out to her. It was big plus that even as a military spouse, she was able to use VA benefits. She loved our assistance with job placement, and noted that she had gone to school twice and neither college offered anything like that.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat’s a typical day for you?\\nCurrently, both panelists are working as developers for VIA Metropolitan Transit. Due to COVID-19, they’re both working from home.\\nEddy usually starts his day early with a coding challenge on a website like Codewars. He has a virtual meeting with his mentor to discuss some code. For most of the day, they solve a problem or do some pair programming. They also have team meetings and daily standups.\\nBridget is currently leading an Artificial Intelligence project with VIA that takes up most of her time. She usually has virtual meetings with members of her team, other teams at VIA, and contractors. She does documentation and uses programs to update the current status of her projects for the team to see.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow is the work-life balance?\\nCoding is a hobby for Bridget. She takes her laptop with her from room to room, sometimes coding with her child in her lap. She loves it so much, she often works late unintentionally until her kids come in the room to check on her. Because of this, she doesn’t feel completely balanced but knows that it’s only because she loves it so much.\\nEddy feels similarly, stating that when they do work late, it’s usually because they want to. The work-life balance has been good for him.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat advice would you give to someone thinking of attending Codeup’s Web Development program?\\nBridget was nervous coming into Codeup, but it gave her everything she was looking for. Part of why she wanted to begin her journey into web development was because she thought developers get to sit around alone, not having to interact with anybody. She very quickly realized this was not the case. “You have to speak up and you have to do it well, and often, with a lot of people. You’ll have to work hard, beyond the regular hours. Take advantage of all the resources. Schedule some meetups with peers to work together outside of class. It’s so worth it in the end. Just go for it!”\\nEddy learned that keeping a part-time job is possible but really, really hard. He was one of the only students ever to finish Codeup while working a job, rushing to work right after class. He regrets doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours. But when he had time, he always tried to work with other students to solve problems together, and encourages the same in others. “Break out of your comfort zone and don’t be scared to just start from where you are. The first couple weeks will be really hard, but learn to fall in love with the feeling of being stuck, because eventually you’ll be able to solve it.”\\nBridget and Eddy are working together at VIA, but took very different pathways to get to where they are. Eddy hadn’t thought much about coding before deciding to dive right into it, whereas Bridget wanted a career as a developer for years. Whether coding is something you never gave much thought to or you’ve tried a different route before, you, too, can make a transition into web development with Codeup!

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/succeed-in-a-coding-bootcamp/',\n",
       "  'content': 'We held a virtual event called “” featuring our Dallas-based Full-Stack Web Development instructors, Douglas Hirsh and Fernando Mendoza. To start our incoming students off on the right foot, we wanted to hear what advice they have to optimize a coding bootcamp experience. Check out their top tips below!\\nPractice\\n“Practical information and practical skills are going to be acquired by practicing every single day.” – Fernando\\nPractice is an essential part of learning something new. You could watch people bake all day long, and still not be any better of a baker yourself. That’s why our students spend more time actually writing code than listening to lectures. You’ll practice alone, with your cohort, and with instructor guidance. Through this practice, you will change the way you think and approach problems. The instructors agreed that practicing on your own through fun side projects, like creating a program to organize your baking recipes, sets the most successful students apart from the rest.\\n\\xa0\\nConsistency\\n“The reason Codeup is every weekday from 9-5 is because we need you to be fully invested. If you only coded on weekends or in your free time, you would forget everything you saw last time and wouldn’t be able to build upon what you know.” – Fernando\\nDon’t just practice. Practice consistently. Many of our students have tried the self-taught route and eventually ended up at Codeup. Why? Practicing every now and then doesn’t cut it when it comes to something as complex as programming, the same way practicing every now and then isn’t how you learn a language or an instrument. The way to succeed at something is by practicing it frequently and consistently. It’s no different for . Codeup is fully immersive for that very purpose.\\n\\xa0\\nPrepare yourself\\n“The best thing you can do is the prework that we assign.” – Douglas\\nHelp your future self by doing the prework assigned before the first day of class.. This isn’t just busy work. It’s for you and only you. We won’t take a grade on it, it’s really, entirely, to set yourself up for success. We will move incredibly fast and it will feel like drinking from a firehose, even if you did do the prework. Do future you a big favor by getting used to what drinking from a firehose feels like!\\n\\xa0\\nProblem solve\\n“Replace frustration with curiosity, then experimentation.” – Fernando\\nAs you consistently practice the prework, you will come across errors. Instead of getting frustrated, let the errors trigger your curiosity of “why isn’t that working?” and “how do I get it to work?” You can google the keywords in the error message and figure out what to do. This gives you practice problem solving on your own instead of immediately asking someone else for help. While we love helping our students, we will expect you to have already tried to figure things out because we believe in your ability to problem solve. When you do need help, this process helps you frame your questions. We won’t give you answers, but we will happily point to a different way of thinking about an error. It will make getting it right that much more satisfying.\\n\\xa0\\nActive learning\\n“We want you to be in the mindset of understanding and not discovery. The prework is what takes you there.”- Fernando\\nProblem solving your way through the prework allows you to be an active participant in your own learning. You’re giving yourself exposure to a topic before class so that during the lecture, you’re not discovering something new, but trying to understand it. You might not get it the first time you see it, but now you know what to look out for in the lecture.\\n\\xa0\\nFailure is temporary\\n“Think about where you were 5 weeks ago. Use evidence over time that things have gotten better rather than dwelling on failure in the moment. Failure is learning. Failure is good.” – Douglas\\nAs you progress through the program, you will face obstacles and failures, and you will doubt yourself as a programmer. When you feel like you can’t do something, compare yourself to who you were and what you could do 5 weeks ago, instead of comparing yourself to “real programmers.” After reminding yourself of your progress, think about what obstacles are keeping you from moving forward and how to overcome them, instead of defaulting to “I can’t.” Kevin Kelley once said, “Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.”\\n\\nLearn to communicate\\n“We have you do group projects and paired programming projects and you get a lot of really good experience working with people remotely. It’s a really good skill to have.” – Douglas\\nProgrammers are not in a room alone all day with 10 screens in front of them.

       "  'content': 'Butterflies in my belly; my stomach is tied up in knots. I know I’m taking a risk by sharing my story, but I wanted to reach out to others aspiring to be a data scientist. I am writing this with hopes that my story will encourage and motivate you.\\xa0\\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nI don’t have a PhD. Heck, I don’t have any degree. Still, I am very fortunate to work as a data scientist in a ridiculously good company. Here’s how I did it (with a lot of help).\\n\\xa0\\nFormative Years\\nIt was 1995 and I had just gotten my very first computer. It was a 1982 Apple IIe. It didn’t come with any software but it came with a manual. That’s how I learned my very first computer language: Apple BASIC.\\nMy love for programming was born.\\nIn Algebra class, I remember learning about the quadratic equation. I had a cheap graphic calculator then, a Casio, that’s about half the price of a TI-82. It came with a manual too, so I decided to write a program that will solve the quadratic equation for me without much hassle.\\nMy love for solving problems was born.\\nIn my senior year, my parents didn’t know anything about financial aid but I was determined to go to college so I decided to join the Navy so that I could use Montgomery GI Bill to pay for my college. After all, four years of service didn’t seem that long.\\nMy love for adventure was born.\\nLater in my career in the Navy, I was promoted as the ship’s financial manager. I was in charge of managing multiple budgets. The experience taught me bookkeeping.\\nMy love for numbers was born.\\nAfter the Navy, I ended up volunteering for a non-profit. They eventually recruited me to start a domestic violence crisis program from scratch. I had no social work experience but I agreed anyway.\\nMy love for saying “Why not?” was born.\\n\\xa0\\nRock Bottom\\nAfter a few successful years, my boss retired and the new boss fired me. I was devastated. I fell into a deep state of clinical depression and I felt worthless.\\nI recall crying very loudly at the kitchen table. It had been more than a year since my non-profit job and I was nowhere near close to having a prospect for the next one. I was in a very dark space.\\nThankfully, the crying fit was a cathartic experience. It gave me a jolt to do some introspection, stop whining, and come up with a plan.\\n“Choose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life.” — Anonymous\\n\\xa0\\nFalling in Love, All Over Again\\nTo pay the bills, I was working as a freelance web designer/developer but I wasn’t happy. Frankly, the business of doing web design bored me. It was frustrating working with clients who think and act like they’re the expert on design.\\nSo I started thinking, “what’s next?”\\nSearching the web, I stumbled upon the latest news in artificial intelligence. It led me to machine learning which in turn led me to the subject of data science.\\nI signed up for Andrew Ng’s machine learning course on Coursera. I listened to TwitML, Linear Digression, and a few other podcasts. I revisited Python and got reacquainted with git on Github.\\nMy love for data science was born.\\nIt was at this time that I made the conscious decision to be a data scientist.\\n\\xa0\\nLeap of Faith\\nLearning something new was fun for me. But still, I had that voice in my head telling me that no matter how much I study and learn, I will never get a job in data science without a degree.\\nSo, I took a hard look in the mirror and acknowledged that I needed help. But I wasn’t sure where to look.\\nThen one day out of the blue, my girlfriend asked me what data science is. I jumped off my feet and started explaining right away. Once I stopped explaining to catch a breath, I managed to ask her why she asked. And that’s when she told me that she’d seen a sign on a billboard. We went for a drive and I saw the sign for myself. It was a curious billboard with two big words “data science” and a smaller one that says “Codeup.” I went to their website and researched their employment outcomes.\\nI was sold.\\n\\xa0\\nPreparation\\nBefore the start of the class, we were given a list of materials to go over.\\n\\nData Science Math Skills — Coursera\\nMathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra — Coursera\\nBasic Statistics — Coursera\\nPython for Data Science — Coursera\\nExcel Basics — Udemy\\nLearning the Command Line — Codecademy\\n\\nGiven that I had only about two months to prepare, I was not expected to finish the courses. But, I did them anyway. I spent day and night going over the courses and materials, did the tests, and got the certificates! I knew then that I could get into data science without a degree.\\n\\xa0\\nBootcamp\\nCodeup was a blur. We had a saying in the Navy about the bootcamp experience: “the days drag on but the weeks fly by.” This was definitely true for the Codeup bootcamp as well.\\nWe were coding in Python, querying the SQL database, and making dashboards in Tableau. We did projects after projects. We learned about different methodologies like regression, classification, clustering, time-series, anomaly detection, natural language processing, and distributed machine learning.\\nMore important than the specific tools, I learned:\\xa0\\n\\nReal data is messy; deal with it.\\nIf you can’t communicate with your stakeholders, you’re useless.\\nDocument your code.\\nRead the documentation.\\nAlways be learning.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nJob Hunting\\nOur job hunting process started from day one. We updated our LinkedIn profile and made sure that we were pushing to Github almost every day. I even spruced up my personal website to include the projects we did during class. And of course, we made sure that our resumé was in good shape.\\nCodeup helped me with all of these.\\nIn addition, Codeup also helped prepare me for both technical and behavioral interviews. The student placement team taught me how to optimize answers to highlight my strengths as a high-potential candidate.\\n\\xa0\\nPost-Graduation\\nMy education continued even after graduation. In between filling out applications, I wrote code every day and tried out different Python libraries. I regularly read the news for the latest developments in machine learning. While doing chores, I would listen to a podcast, a TedTalk, or a LinkedIn learning video. When bored, I listened to or read books about data or professional development.\\nI’ve had a lot of rejections. The first one was the hardest but after that, it kept getting easier. I developed a thick skin and learned to keep moving.\\n\\xa0\\nConclusion\\nIt took me 3 months after graduating from Codeup to get a job. When I got the job offer, I felt very grateful, relieved, and excited.\\nI could not have done it without Codeup and my family’s support. It is possible to start a career in data science without a degree!\\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nThis blog post was written by Ednalyn C.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-student-experience/',\n",
       "  'content': 'Our Transition into Data Science Panel event was full of passion. The audience met three of our current students: Jada Shipp, formerly a Newborn Hearing Specialist, Daniel Guerrero, who was a Vaccine Product Manager, and Ryan McCall, who was an overnight Surveillance Agent at Walmart. They discussed what led them to this career path, how their Data Science bootcamp experience has been so far, and what they plan to do after Codeup. Read on to learn about the Codeup Data Science bootcamp experience and their key takeaways and advice!\\n\\xa0\\nWhy data science?\\nThe students began by discussing their “whys” and “hows” of pursuing data science at Codeup.\\nJada: I was going to apply to medical school but decided it wasn’t for me. A friend suggested Codeup, which is how I learned about data science. I realized it’s something I was already interested in. I was really big on solving all my problems in school on Excel and coming up with the best graphs and digging around in numbers. I just didn’t know there was a name for this, and certainly didn’t know it was a career path.\\nDaniel: At a new job as a Vaccine Product Manager, they started asking me to do research about where we’re selling our product and who’s buying. I quickly discovered this was a massive, billion dollar company and there was no one there that actually knew how to use Excel or how to look at sales. It was mind blowing to me because I thought this was standard and everyone was doing it. Then I realized my company is not the only one that has this gap.\\nRyan: I went to college for chemistry, then started working security but wasn’t satisfied with it. I wanted to use my brain more to think and actively solve problems at my job. So, I started looking at programming as a job career. I found data science and absolutely fell in love with it and spent two years trying to teach it to myself on the side of my security job. It was very hard, I spent most of that time figuring out what resources to trust. It’s a lot easier being taught than searching in the dark.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is the learning process like at Codeup?\\nLots of us know how it feels to come out of a full semester of class feeling like we didn’t absorb anything and not knowing how it applies to real life. Not here.\\nJada: I thought getting admitted was a mistake and they’d kick me out at any time. I had zero coding experience and I really didn’t think I could do it. But I went step by step. ‘Maybe I can’t do this but I can probably do this one tiny part of it.’ They’ll explain it in as many different ways as they need to until your lightbulb goes on.\\xa0\\nDaniel: They’ll give you questions that force you to think. They won’t just give you an answer. You have to figure it out yourself but they give you the tools to be able to do that. And because of the collaborative environment, we’re learning from each other as a cohort and not just instructors. Now, I’m able to branch out into new territories and not be scared to do so because I’m well equipped.\\nRyan: I’m honestly amazed by what we can do in such a short amount of time. I can do things that I thought it would take me years to do.\\n\\xa0\\nHow are you liking Data Science at Codeup?\\nIn such an immersive, fast-paced environment, it was a joy to hear how much our students have loved their experience so far.\\nJada: Everything we do every week, I’m like “This is so cool! Last week was nothing!”\\nDaniel: Every week I have the same conversation with my parents about the program. “What are you doing this week?” “Oh it’s my favorite thing!” “You say that every week!” But other than everything, the projects are the coolest thing for me.\\nRyan: We could talk about this for hours, we love this stuff! Aside from loving the material, you become like a little family. We’ve had all the same bad experiences, all the same good experiences. You’re speaking a similar language and you can figure it out together.\\n\\xa0\\nHow are we helping you get the job you want?\\nIn between lessons, students work closely with our placement team, where we help students land awesome jobs.\\nJada: I want to use data in health care. I have a degree in Public Health and worked as an EMT, a scribe, and a hearing screener. Now, I want to merge my passion for public health with data science skills. I’m pretty confident I can get a job like this because the Codeup placement team helps you through every step– resume, Linkedin, interview skills. They are not gonna let you fall by the wayside. They remember you and who you are and what you’re looking for. It’s not a generic cookie cutter process where you get what you get. They know you and it’s customized for you.\\nDaniel: I told the placement team that I want to work with data that’s business to customer. Two days later they sent me applications and they’re actually what I asked for, in industries I actually told them about, with companies I actually mentioned. I was mind blown! The placement team will open as many doors as they possibly can to get you the right opportunity, I am more than impressed with the placement team.\\nRyan: I want to be a data scientist and I don’t know what kind of data scientist, I just want to be one! And they can work with that, too!\\n\\xa0\\nAny tips for incoming students?\\nAll three panelists said the same thing: DO THE PREWORK!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHere are some resources they used:\\n\\nTo have something explained to you “like you’re 5 years old,” which Jada at times needed: https://www.khanacademy.org/\\nTo learn Python specifically in terms of data: https://www.dataquest.io/\\u2029\\nTo start recognizing patterns in data science and build a repository for later: https://www.codewars.com/dashboard\\u2029 and https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard\\n\\u2029To help with Python and Pandas: https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists\\u2029\\nOur events, including a free Python workshop: https://codeup.com/events/\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWe want to thank Jada, Daniel, and Ryan for sharing their passion with us and acting as mentors for prospective and current students for the night. They are each blossoming into data scientists that couldn’t hide how much they love what they do even if they tried. Do you want a similar transition? Start your own Data Science bootcamp experience today by learning more. Scared it’s too risky and you won’t get a job? That’s okay, we’ll refund your tuition if you don’t. Any more excuses? There won’t be once you give us a call.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Are you a veteran or active-duty military member considering your next steps? Our alumni have been in your boots. In a recent virtual panel, two military veterans in tech discussed their transition into the field with Codeup: Benny Fields III, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant turned Full Stack Web Developer, and Jeffery Roeder, a Navy Intelligence Analyst turned Data Scientist. Whether you’re interested in Data Science or Web Development, here are some key takeaways from the event.\\xa0\\nWhy Codeup?\\n“The GI Bill was a huge plus, but the icing on the cake was the placement program.” – Benny Fields\\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, Benny Fields took a job as a technical writer, but he quickly became more interested in the software he was writing about than the writing itself. His friend suggested looking into a coding bootcamp, which he did. He liked that Codeup accepts the GI Bill to help military veterans in tech, and the icing on the cake for him was learning about the work our student placement team does to get you hired.\\nWhat does Codeup’s Student Placement Team do?\\n“They’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed. They have tons of connections- it’s crazy. Colleges aren’t gonna do that for you.” – Jeff Roeder\\nWe’ll buff up your resume, set up mock interviews, and give you the know-how to nail your interviews and get a job offer. From how to dress, to what to say in a thank you letter, Jeff said it best: we’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed in a new career. And it’s backed up by our tuition refund.\\xa0\\nHow did you pass the technical assessments during the application process?\\n\\xa0“They basically tailored their workshop to me. That’s the kinda stuff that Codeup’s gonna do, they’ll get you there!” – Jeff Roeder\\nJeff Roeder heard about Data Science classes at Codeup from a friend who had seen our “crazy billboards” (one of which features Benny). He’s a former intelligence analyst, but the admissions process wasn’t entirely a breeze for him. After studying and studying, Python just wasn’t clicking, and he failed one of his technical assessments. He was about to give up on it, but our admissions team wasn’t ready to give up on him. We personally invited him to one of our Saturday workshops where we taught him step by step how to build the foundation he needed.\\xa0\\nHow does your military experience relate to your experience at Codeup?\\n“They were like ‘hey, you’re gonna learn Spanish and you only have six months to do it,’ which is much like going to Codeup to learn something new, you only have six months to do it.” – Jeff Roeder\\nWhen Jeff first joined the Navy as a linguist, he was told to learn Spanish in six months. When he joined Codeup, he was told to learn Data Science in five months. They were both immersive experiences where people of different personalities and different cultures joined together for a common goal. As Jeff put it, you may not always like someone or relate to them, but you need each other to accomplish what needs to get done.\\n“Coming to Codeup, I had to be flexible because I had to learn to adapt to new technologies with new people that were way younger than me and were catching on faster.” – Benny Fields\\nFor Benny, one similarity is that in the Air Force, you have to be flexible. He was used to having a planned day and changing it at the drop of a hat. In the tech field, things are always changing, and flexibility and constant learning are essential. This is where the military flexibility really came in handy for him.\\nJeff and Benny may have completed different Codeup programs but they both had the same journey from bootcamp to bootcamp. Both failed their technical assessments at first and had to leverage our resources to get through the admissions process. They both worked with our financial aid team to use their VA benefits for the course, and they both left Codeup with a job and a new skillset. Both are now successful military veterans in tech!\\nMission accomplished.\\n\\xa0\\nIf you’re looking for your next step and want to learn more about using VA benefits to attend Codeup, talk with our team today!

Our Data Science Instructor, Ryan Orsinger, has seen 36 cohorts of students come through Codeup and helped build their problem-solving skills through live, audience-centered lectures. Check out his recipe for success below:\\nScenario:\\nYou’re learning to code, learning the syntax for a programming language, and working on thinking programmatically. The lesson or lecture is completed and now you’re now facing a programming problem that is expecting you to understand and apply the new content.\\n\\nHow do you get started?\\n\\xa0\\nHere’s your algorithm for getting started:\\n1. With intent, read the curriculum and the code examples.\\n2. Go back and deliberately read the example code very closely and slowly.\\n3. Copy any example code into your editor.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify the pieces of syntax that you recognize.\\nIdentify the code for the new concept that you’re working with.\\nAsk yourself how the syntax or concepts you know already support and connect with the new topic or new syntax. Often, the new is relatable in terms of the old.\\nAsk yourself questions about the code example\\n\\nWhat is this entire code example supposed to do?\\nWhat piece of the language is this new concept?\\nIs the new code a new piece of syntax? Or is it an existing piece of syntax?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Run the example code\\n5. Observe results. Think about each piece of code. What is it doing, what did you expect it to do?\\n6. Try modifying the example code so that you change variables to see different results (one at a time…)\\nIf the example code demonstrates how to make a loop from 0 to 9:\\n– Modify the code to make a loop that starts at 1 and ends at 10.\\n– Modify the code to make a loop that starts at 10 and counts down to 0.\\n7. Try removing as many moving pieces from the code for the new concept as possible… try to isolate a unit of work that uses the new concept and test it in isolation\\n8. Read the first exercise problem. Read it slowly, with attention to detail.\\n9. Ask yourself questions about the exercise:\\n\\nCan you explain or restate the problem in plain English?\\nAre you able to write down the steps from problem to solution in English, without using any code?\\nBreak the exercise down into pieces. Each piece is either something you’ve seen or it’s new.\\nGiven the concept for this lesson, identify which part of the exercise uses the new topic\\nFor the new piece, what is similar between the exercise code and the example code for the lesson?\\n\\n10. Work to write code for a smaller problem than the exercise asks.\\nIf the exercise says:\\n– Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 50\\n– If the input is not numeric or out of that range, ask them again for a number. Repeat until they give a number between 1 and 50.\\n– Start by making sure you’re able to prompt a user, then store the result of prompt to a variable for later.\\n– Go after the low-hanging fruit first. Momentum begets momentum.\\n11. If you’re still having problems and stuck, go to step 1.\\n12. If friction, confusion, and “writer’s block” persist, then ask for help from another human being. Explain the steps you’ve already taken, and attempt to ask your question as clearly as possible. Here’s a good resource on how to ask effective questions!\\n\\n\\n\\nRyan Orsinger is a proud instructor here at Codeup.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/data-science/career-in-data-science/',\n",
       "  'content': 'In our blog, “The Best Path To A Career In Software Development,” we looked at how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career than traditional undergraduate CS degree programs. Today we’re here to talk to you about how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career in data science than a Master’s Degree.\\xa0\\n“But don’t I need a degree to get a job as a data scientist?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. The answer is yes and no. Yes, because most jobs in data science require some form of higher education. No, because that degree doesn’t have to be in something related to data science – data scientists have degrees in many different areas of study! So if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career, fear no more.\\nWhile a Master’s Degree provides a lot of value, it isn’t the most direct path for a job. With the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data, data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultra-specialized workforce. Companies now need much larger teams to analyze, model, and leverage the data they’ve collected. So while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development, it’s now a playground for those with some Python skills who know how to find valuable insights in a mess of data.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nNow let’s get a bit more specific. If modern roles in data science demand more practical skills, why is a bootcamp a better path?\\n\\xa0\\n#1: Responsive curriculum: Barely 10 years ago nobody had heard of data science. But in that short amount of time, the tools and technologies in the field have grown exponentially. Each year sees the introduction of new packages, visualization tools, and cutting edge technologies. With such a rapidly evolving landscape, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. With our ears tuned directly to employers, we’re able to adapt quickly and ensure we’re teaching what hiring managers need.\\n\\xa0\\n#2 Hands-on Project-Based Learning: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. A career in data science is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#3 Progressive Curriculum Structure: In a traditional degree, students study by taking several classes at a time. You may begin with data structures and algorithms, then move to SQL, then take Python, and so on. But real-world data science doesn’t work so neatly. You will never face a project where you’re only working with one of those tools, so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demands. Our program focuses on real-world deliverables at every step of the journey, while exposing you to increasingly complex problems and projects. You start off applying basic tools to simple challenges. Then, we begin varying the data sets, the way you access that data, the type of methodology you use, and the deliverable you’re responsible for. To put it simply, the structure of a traditional degree teaches you how to use a hammer, a saw, and a chisel. Codeup teaches you how to build a stool, a birdbox, and a sculpture with those tools, and when to use which.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#4 Job Placement Services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most graduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#5 Messy Data: This is probably the most important difference between us and traditional degrees. We use real, messy, misleading, broken data so you learn how to draw insights from the real thing. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. Because of the segmented class structure, traditional degrees have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill. At Codeup, you’re always applying your tools to a real deliverable, so we’re able to use real data sets that intersect the challenges of multiple skills.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLastly, we encourage you to think about the return on your investment in your education.\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeup*\\nPrivate Master’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$29,500\\n6 months\\n85% graduation rate\\n88%\\xa0 employment rate\\n$67,500 median starting salary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$62,280\\n18-24 months\\n61% graduation rate\\n72.5% employment rate\\n$59,866 median starting salary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*read more on our outcomes\\n\\xa0\\nMost importantly, the opportunity cost of pursuing a master’s degree is equal to 13-19 months of employment. At a median salary of $67,500 from Codeup, that’s between $67,500-$101,250 in foregone earnings.\\xa0\\nSo, you want a career in data science? A career accelerator like Codeup is the path for you.

We’re still giving live instruction, we’re just teaching from behind a laptop instead of a podium.\\nIn addition to live instruction, our students enjoy live co-learning. You’re not in this alone! In fact, our cohorts of 20-25 students provide a built-in structure of camaraderie, networking, and technical support. Some of the best learning you can do is by teaching to and learning from other students, a benefit that is lost in attending a part-time or self-paced program.\\nThe combination of live instruction and peer-peer connectivity produces a third benefit: accountability. In this remote world where your couch is your desk, it can be challenging to stay focused and motivated. Our immersive program builds accountability through a daily course schedule, project-based learning, social support, and a helping hand. [Editor’s note: if this weren’t important and learning to code on your own were easy, I’d be writing Java right now instead of a blog post!]\\nLastly, the reason Codeup offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee is that we teach directly to the needs of employer partners. Right now, more than ever before, employers need employees who are adaptable and able to work remotely! The remote Codeup experience prepares you to communicate, collaborate, and code remotely, a skill that was already valuable in the tech industry. If anything, you’re getting a little extra bang for your buck by learning a skillset most developers have to earn the hard way.\\nAlthough we wish we were on campus high-fiving, writing code, and re-enacting Star Wars lightsabers battles, we’ve realized that’s not really what the Codeup experience is about. The true Codeup experience is about learning to code from experienced professionals alongside passionate students in a live, hands-on environment that offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee. That’s what you can always expect from Codeup, whether we’re remote or not.\\nIf you’ve been affected by COVID-19 in any way (layoffs, health, family, etc.), check out our recently announced COVID-19 Relief Scholarship.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Last year, I knew I needed to make a career change, but I had no idea where to begin. I had fallen into the trap of working mindless jobs only to make ends meet. I was hungry for success and ready to transition from a “job” to a “career,” but I did not know what would get me there. After conducting a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the tech industry is where I wanted to get started, specifically as a web developer. Unfortunately, when I did a Google search for “coding bootcamp,” I came across about 6,000,000 results. Some programs offered courses online, in-person, or a combination of the two. As for the financial options, programs either offered financial assistance or none at all. I was having a difficult time choosing the best program for me because I was left with so many questions.\\n\\xa0\\nTo find answers to my questions, I decided to schedule calls with the programs I was interested in. After talking to several bootcamps, I was able to narrow down my options. I needed a program located in San Antonio, TX that offered in-person learning and tuition assistance. This was when I knew Codeup was the best possible option for me. I wanted an in-person experience because I needed an environment that would help me find the success I was after. As I did my research on Codeup, it became clear that they were going to provide the best experience for me.\\nNow that I graduated and am looking back, I know I made the right decision. While I could mention all of the many ways that Codeup changed my life, I want to share some of the benefits for any individuals considering going here. Every day, I was taught by experienced instructors from all types of backgrounds and with various teaching styles. I had an amazing cohort that shared the journey with me and I can confidently say that I have made lifelong friends. I was also surrounded by an amazing network of alumni, staff, employer partners, and the tech community in San Antonio. Everything about Codeup is so much more effective because it is in-person. One of my favorite experiences at Codeup was the career simulation and preparation. I was able to work one-on-one with a professional that is going to help place me in my first web developer position. I feel like none of this success would have been possible if I decided to take an alternate route through an online program or part-time environment.\\nEditor’s Update: While COVID-19 remains prevalent, classes will be conducted online as a necessity. However, the live online classroom simulates an in-person environment with video lecture and lab, breakout rooms, office hours, reviews, exams, and more, right alongside your cohort! The career simulation and preparation hasn’t ended, in fact, it’s even more developed! Learn more about Codeup Remote, here.\\nGoing to school full-time was not an easy task, but here is how I made it possible:\\xa0\\n\\nFinances: I saved up enough money to cover my bills while I was in school. I also received a scholarship through Codeup and was awarded a grant through Project QUEST.\\nTime management: I surrounded myself with a team of family and friends that provided me with endless support. They understood that I was going to have late nights and go weeks without seeing them. I planned my days accordingly and always made sure to prioritize school first.\\nRewards: Throughout my time at Codeup, I found it necessary to give myself little rewards. Whenever I would get through a challenging day or successfully complete a project, I would allow myself a special treat like a Starbucks coffee or a cheap lunch at a restaurant with my cohort.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you are considering Codeup’s web development program, my advice is that you ask yourself if you are ready to commit to changing your career and ultimately your life in five months. A full-time program is not easy, but the outcome is going to be worth it if you put in hard work. Remember that you are not sacrificing your time, but are instead investing in a better version of you.\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nBeverly Jaimes-Puente is a Web Developer in the San Antonio area.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/how-to-pick-coding-bootcamp-curriculum/',\n",
       "  'content': 'If you’re thinking about entering a career as a software developer, you’ve probably researched a few different bootcamps. During your research, you’ve probably seen a few different curricula. Without already BEING a software developer, it’s hard to know what’s what. In this post, we want to explore how to think about a bootcamp curriculum and recommend strategies about how to consider the best fit.\\nLet’s start with some terminology. Full-stack web development integrates work on both the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the user-facing side that you interact within a web browser. The back-end is the server-side that involves the sending and receiving of data. Consider a restaurant website. A front-end only website would show a restaurant menu with prices, dishes, and ordering information. A full-stack web application would allow you to not only view the menu but place an order and process payment information for that order, interacting with a database and back-end functionality.\\nWithin that understanding, there are a few groupings of technologies:\\n\\nObject-Oriented Programming and back-end tech: This list includes programming languages like PHP, Java, C#, Ruby, and Node.js. These allow you to build functionalities into a web application.\\xa0\\nDatabase tools: Tools like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle let you store, send, and receive information.\\nFront-end technologies: Languages and frameworks like JavaScript, Angular, React, HTML, and CSS let you design a front-end interface.\\nWeb frameworks: Spring Boot and Laravel are examples of web frameworks that help you stand up web applications more efficiently.\\xa0\\nTesting tools: In production, many companies leverage a methodology called Test Driven Development. This is when developers write tests first, and code second, letting them compare their code against a standard of approval. Common technologies include JUnit, PHPUnit, NUnit, MSTest, Jasmine.\\n\\nWith so many technologies out there, it can be hard to pick what’s best to learn. But here’s the secret: the specific technologies do not matter. The most important thing you’ll learn during a coding bootcamp is how to use these different categories of technologies. Whether you learn PHP or Java, MySQL, or\\xa0 SQL Server, the important takeaways are the fundamental concepts learned. Many Codeup alumni graduate from our Full-Stack Java program and go on to work in PHP, Python, Ruby, Groovy, and other languages. Ultimately, a loop is a loop and an array is an array. Languages differ, but once you’ve learned an OOP language, the differences become syntactical instead of conceptual.\\xa0\\nThis leads us to an important point: the more technologies, the worse! The quality of a curriculum, and thus the value of it, is not defined by the number of technologies covered. In fact, it’s the opposite. Let’s give some examples.\\nColumbia University is one of the premier academic institutions in the world. They are an Ivy League university with a strong reputation. In 2018, they expanded into the bootcamp space and launched a web development program that covers the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more. All of that in 12 weeks. Let’s decode that for you with the terms we’ve already used. This curriculum promises to teach you:\\n\\nObject-Oriented Programming and back-end tech: Node.js\\nDatabase tools: Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL\\nFront-end technologies: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js\\n\\nNow let’s look at Codeup. We teach: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Spring, MySQL. All of that, in 22 weeks. In the terms we’ve discussed, that’s:\\xa0\\n\\nObject-Oriented Programming and back-end tech: Java, Spring\\nDatabase tools: MySQL\\nFront-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery\\n\\nThe common initial thought is: why spend 22 weeks learning seven technologies when you could spend 12 weeks learning 10? And there lies the misconception. Many bootcamp curricula promise to teach you the latest and greatest technologies: React.js, Angular.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, etc. etc. etc. That may sound like a better bang for your buck, but it’s all a question of priority. Here is the reality of your choices:\\n\\nColumbia bootcamp, broad and shallow: gain exposure to a wide variety of technologies in a short amount of time\\nCodeup, narrow and deep: gain expertise in software development fundamentals in a narrow scope of technologies\\n\\nThere is no inherently right answer here – it’s all about your priorities. That being said, here’s what we believe: Learning how to learn, learning how to think like a developer, and learning to program is far more important than gaining exposure to the latest web frameworks. When you understand programming fundamentals, you prepare yourself to learn whatever you want. It’s like learning how to work with a car: it’s great to know how to drive an Audi, but it’s pretty different from understanding how an Audi engine works and how it differs from a Honda.\\xa0\\nAt Codeup, we focus on crafting you into a software developer. We focus on programming fundamentals, core web technologies, and applied practices. When you graduate, you’re ready to land a job and have the skills to learn any technology.

       "  'content': 'Codeup has trained over 500 software developers over 6 years in San Antonio. But we’re new to town here in Dallas, so we’re getting a lot of questions. Top of that list is, “Why are y’all so much more expensive than the other bootcamps in town?” In case you haven’t noticed, our Full-Stack Web Development program tuition is an investment of $27,500. But the secret is, we don’t cost that much – we’re worth that much. Codeup isn’t a bootcamp – it’s a career accelerator. Tuition is an investment in your future, and the ROI pays off. Let’s dive into why!\\nFirst of all, the upfront investment to enroll at Codeup is only $1,000 – a down payment to secure your seat. The entirety of the rest of your tuition can be arranged with a combination of scholarships, grants, and loans to support the remaining investment. Our dedicated Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager helps you navigate all the intricacies of tuition planning (if you want to get a head start, read our blog about bootcamp funding, explained).\\nCodeup focuses on quality. While other bootcamps leveraged venture-funding and corporate capital to expand quickly, opening 10+ campuses at a time, Codeup opened one campus. While other programs focused on volume, we focused on quality. We spent five years refining our program before expanding. Here’s the result that you now get to enjoy:\\n\\nA custom-built, high-quality curriculum: other bootcamps have made their instructors build curriculum while they taught it…(Link blog post about our curriculum)\\nTop-knotch instruction: Your instructors have a combined 30 years of software development experience and 10 years of formal teaching experience. Local bootcamps hire 1 experienced instructor for every 5 alumni TAs.\\xa0\\nJob outcomes: In 2019, we placed 99% of our alumni in new careers in-field. Even when we operated exclusively in San Antonio, we placed 18 students in Dallas for an average starting salary of $85,000. The Codeup promise is simple: get a job or 100% of your money back.\\nPrivate ownership: Codeup launched in 2014 with 3 co-founders. After the first class, the company had re-paid initial investment and was cash-flow positive. Since then, our growth has been entirely organic. We’ve never taken outside investment, split equity, leveraged debt capital, or lost control of the business in any way. Our 3 co-founders are our 3 owners. Other bootcamps have been bought, sold, traded, closed…they change hands as assets in a venture capital investment game. What does that mean for you? We focus on your outcome, they focus on their bottom line. Anybody been following WeWork lately? The valuation bubble is bursting, and our students won’t get caught on the wrong side. PS, WeWork owns the Flatiron bootcamp…\\n\\nIf you’re considering a bootcamp education, you’re really considering an investment in yourself. Let’s be really clear – this is NOT school. This isn’t a high school diploma, an Associate’s or a BS in CS. This is a pathway to a career, the salary that will earn, and the meaning it will bring. Put on your investment hat: the upfront $$ isn’t as important as the Return On Investment. Our Dallas-bound graduates have had an average starting salary of $85,000. At less than 6 months long, you still have more than 6 months to work in that year. So what is your ROI? In the same year you are trained, you earn back your money. Within 12 months, you 3x your money.\\nYou might ask, why not use that same math on a cheaper program? The answer is simple: other bootcamps don’t view it the same way. They are giving you an education, you are giving them a return on THEIR investment. Let’s take a more specific look:'},\n",

We’re here to tell you once and for all: college is NOT the best way to become a software developer.\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there is a lot of merit to a four year degree, as well as a lot of valuable knowledge from a CS program that can apply to life as a developer. However, if your goal is to get a job as a software developer, there’s a more direct path.\\nThink of it this way:my plumbing is old and broken, and I need to replace it all. I hire a PhD in Fluid Dynamics – someone who really understands flow, gravity, resistance, momentum, and all the intricacies of what’s happening in my pipes. They come and explain how everything is supposed to work in my new pipes, charge me $5,000 for their time, and then leave. With my pipes still broken, I decided to hire a plumber – someone who knows how to identify the problem and fix it,and a week later my plumbing is fully functional and I’ve only spent $2,500. [Note, we kind of made these numbers up to illustrate a point. After all, we’re no drain surgeons.]\\nThe message here is simple: theory is not the same thing as practical experience. With the rapid growth in web and IT, we’re no longer just dealing with cutting-edge technologies. Development is becoming the new blue-collar factory work, and the amount of code out there is astounding. It’s no longer as important to have high-level abstract education. Instead, the top priority is up-to-date practical experience.\\nNow, let’s get more specific. Why exactly is a coding bootcamp the better way to get a job as a software developer?\\n#1 Technologies: Technology changes at the speed of light. One day the popular framework is Angular, and the next it’s React. In one generation, companies are building with C++ and in the next they’re building with Java. Because of this rate of change, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. While they continue to teach C++, we’ve moved on to Java with a Spring framework and MySQL database. Because we’re more agile, we are able to keep pace with industry trends.\\n#2 Curriculum structure: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduce amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. This career is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.\\n#3 Job placement services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most undergraduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\\xa0\\n#4 Programming hours: This is similar to number 2, but so important that it’s worth repeating. The single most important thing a would-be developer can do is spend time writing code. Practice, practice, practice is the lesson above all else. You need to engage with the problem-solving cycle, learn how to fail, and learn to overcome the barriers inherent in programming. It’s a lot like learning an instrument. When you start out, you struggle to play single notes. You then practice scales and exercises, and before long you’re playing songs, thinking about the intonation and sound over playing the notes. With programming, you need to spend hours to get the basics under your fingers in order to graduate to complex problem-solving and application development. At Codeup, you spend 670 hours in hands-on, instructor-led classroom time. For those of you who like math, that’s roughly equivalent to the number of hours in a four-year degree. It just happens in 6 months, and those hours are hands-on.\\nIf you’re still not convinced, consider the story of Po. Po graduated from Trinity University with a 4 year degree in Computer Science. He graduated with a good GPA, but couldn’t find work as a web developer for a whole year. Companies told him he didn’t have enough full-stack experience, a big enough portfolio, and was lacking modern technologies and languages. So, he came to Codeup. He paired his theory knowledge with our practical knowledge and landed a job immediately upon graduation. Since then, he’s moved to Dallas to join Cognizant, where he’s been able to double his salary and move into a new position as a lead developer. Learn more about Po’s journey here.\\nSo, you want to be a software developer? A career accelerator like Codeup is the path for you. Still not convinced? Contact us and we’ll talk it out.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Anyone who has ever thought about a coding bootcamp has probably run up against this first barrier: the investment. Paying for a bootcamp is scary and confusing because it’s different from traditional education. There are no Pell grants or FAFSA loans. The university tuition center doesn’t process your application 6 months in advance. Today’s blog is here to break down financial aid and tuition funding for bootcamps.\\nFirst off, if you want to attend a bootcamp, there are a lot of ways to make it work financially. We recommend starting with the question of “Is this the right path for me?” instead of “Can I afford this investment?”, so you don’t count yourself out before the race starts.\\nNow, let’s dive into the types of tuition funding available:\\n\\nSelf-payment: This is the most straightforward form of payment. Many bootcamps will accept cash, check, credit card, and ACH. Some will even accept bitcoin!\\xa0\\nLoans: Probably the most common payment type is to secure a loan through a private third-party provider. A loan is when an entity lends you money that you repay over time with interest. Students are likely familiar with loans from FAFSA, but the bootcamp space is a little different. Traditional degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited and governed under the federal Department of Education. That means they are eligible for federal funding for student loans. However, most bootcamps do not grant credit and are not accredited. Since the emergence of the bootcamp model, we have also seen the growth in private providers who are specifically tailored to the bootcamp model. For example, Codeup partners with Ascent\\xa0Funding, Climb, and Meritize.\\xa0\\nGrants: A grant is a source of funding paid on your behalf without a requirement to be repaid, most often targeted at a particular mission. Many grants focus on workforce development and unemployment support. For example, Codeup partners with Workforce Solutions Alamo, Project QUEST, Skill QUEST, and Alamo Colleges who have provided grant funding for students to lower their tuition costs.\\nScholarships: Scholarships fall into two buckets: externally-funded and internally-funded. Externally-funded scholarships are those where a third party, other than the school and the individual, pays for a portion of tuition. Internal scholarships are usually offered as tuition discounts from the school itself. For example, Codeup offers about $27,000 per class in scholarships to women, minorities, LGBTQIA, veterans, and first responders to increase access to tech careers.\\nVA Benefits: The last and least common form of tuition payment is VA Benefits. There are two groups here. Schools that have been in operation for over 2 years can apply to utilize VA Educational Benefits so transitioning service members and military veterans can use government benefits to cover school costs, most commonly with the Post 9-11 GI Bill. The second type of benefit falls under Employment Benefits, through which eligible providers can accept Vocational Rehabilitation, allowing veterans with 10% or more of service-related disability to re-skill. Codeup was one of the first bootcamps to be approved by the VA and offers both of the above forms of benefits. Schools must go through a rigorous approval process and ongoing compliance requirements to accept these benefits.\\n\\nNow that you have an understanding of the types of benefits for your investment, let’s understand their relative pros and cons.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Type of funding\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Pros\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-payment\\n\\nNo interest\\nNo application process\\nFull payment due up front\\n\\n\\n\\nLoans\\n\\nDeferred tuition payment\\nLoan interest accrues\\n\\n\\n\\nGrants\\n\\nFree money!\\nApplication and eligibility determination process\\n\\n\\nScholarships\\nFree money!\\n\\nNot everyone is eligible\\n\\n\\n\\nVA Benefits\\nTuition and monthly housing stipend\\n\\nOnly veterans and dependents are eligible\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s next? The remaining problem is that planning your tuition is still a complicated and multifaceted process. You have to explore grant eligibility, apply for scholarships, qualify for loans, and arrange payments.

Our first class graduated 17 students with an 88% employment rate for an average starting salary of $72,000. In January 2020, our second class is cranking through their final capstone projects, in which they take a Data Science project to life. As we gear up to launch our 3rd class in February 2020, let’s take a moment to introduce you to the incredible data science instructors ready to help you change careers.\\xa0\\nBetween them, Maggie Giust, Zach Gulde, and Ryan Orsinger have over 20 years of technical industry experience. They’ve worked as data analysts, data scientists, software developers, curriculum developers, instructors, and more. They’ve worked at large companies like Rackspace and HEB, and smaller companies like Whiskr and Grok Interactive. Together, they have over 12 years of teaching experience at Codeup and the university level\\nAs we’ve talked about before (see: What is Data Science blog), Data Science is the intersection of programming, math/stats, and domain expertise. That means that in order to learn this material and make a successful career transition, it’s even more important in this field than any other to have a diverse set of instructor backgrounds. Let’s break down our staff expertise by those categories:\\nDomain expertise: Domain expertise means having deep technical experience AND applying that experience across multiple industries and domains.\\xa0\\nMaggie has worked in data science for 7 years and data roles for 10. Maggie worked in finance, practicing data science for security intelligence with Capital Group, built machine learning recommender systems for consumer retail at HEB, and produced data science insights at Rackspace to improve customer satisfaction.\\xa0 Prior to joining Codeup, Maggie’s educational experience includes teaching high school math as well as the development and delivery of data science content and curriculum at both Codeup and Trinity University, where she serves as an adjunct instructor of data science.\\nZach has been instructing, writing curriculum, and programming internal applications for Codeup since 2016. He has instructed hundreds of programmers and is Codeup’s principle curriculum developer. If you printed out all the curriculum Zach has authored for both Data Science and Web Development, it would be more than 1000 pages. In addition to his work with Codeup, Zach has worked on big data projects in the travel industry.\\nRyan began building web applications for small and medium-sized businesses in 2007 and has written software ranging from custom CRM systems for real estate brokerages to an event management platform for Dell. As Codeup’s most senior instructor, Ryan has instructed and mentored 37 data scientists and over 500 software developers.\\nThis means that you will learn what businesses value from instructors who are experienced practitioners who have created technical solutions for multiple industries.\\nMath/Stats: Maggie holds a BS in Mathematics from UTSA and is currently working on her Master’s degree in Data Analytics. Ryan holds a BA from Trinity University in economics. In addition to building out the statistics curriculum for Codeup’s Data Science program, Zach is working on his degree in Software Development. One of our students said they learned more in one week of stats at Codeup than an entire semester at college.\\xa0\\nProgramming: This is really where we shine! Zach and Ryan have been teaching at Codeup for 4 years in our web development program and have developed special depth of expertise in programming and teaching programming. They each have experience across OOP in Java, PHP, and Python, as well as database experience in SQL and web framework expertise in Laravel and Spring. They each have experience in both object oriented and functional programming, and experience building database-backed full-stack web applications in numerous languages (including Python, Java, Javascript, and Clojure) and web frameworks. Maggie has been working in R and Python for years in her different data science roles. When it comes to programming, these 3 can not only build you a Machine Learning model, but they can build a full-stack application, hosting infrastructure, database, and simple UI to go along with it.\\nWhat does this mean for you? When you join Codeup, you step into a classroom where the diverse skills needed in the field are represented in spades in your instructional staff. Not only that, but these are three incredible human beings with a passion for education and up-leveling others.

       "  'content': 'By Ryan Smith, Codeup Alumnus\\nWhenever I tell someone that I’m a software developer,\\xa0I generally get the surprised “You? You’re a software developer?”.\\nI, like many others that have graduated from Codeup, don’t fit the mold most people think of when they think of people in tech.\\nTo be honest, I can barely believe that I am one as well. Throughout 12 years in school, I was a straight C or D student when it came to math or science and wasn’t super excited about college. When I graduated, instead of going to college, I became a missionary in Colombia for two years. Colombia was an intense, immersive experience and I figured that when I got back to the States I would try out college. The results?\\xa0I lasted a semester in college and did horrible in my science class. My first week in college and I called a Marine Corps recruiter to let him know that I would be joining as soon as possible. College just wasn’t for me. A week after my first semester and I was in boot camp. I spent the next 5 years in The Marine Corps mostly as a military working dog handler, trainer and instructor. It was honestly the best job I ever had.\\nUnfortunately, the military had other plans for me that didn’t involve working with dogs, so I got out and worked as a private security dog handler at the Baghdad embassy for a short time. I figured this was the next logical step. I came to find out that the job sounded good on paper, but sitting at a guard shack for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, left me feeling unfulfilled and wanting more out of my life. A week before going back to Baghdad for the last time, I was toying with the idea of coding and came across Codeup. I was accepted into the program a couple of days later and left for Baghdad and started once I returned. Compared to all my life experiences, Codeup was mentally one of the hardest things I’ve accomplished. But if I can do it, so can you. What would have taken me years and years to accomplish, took me about 5 months. Less than two weeks after I graduated Codeup I was offered a job as a software developer at a well-known company where I’ll start in about a week.\\nThe decision to go to Codeup, give it my all and come out the other side a software developer- will affect my life in every way and also that of my future family. I’m grateful for all the staff and instructors there and thankful that I don’t just have a graduation certificate, but the actual skills I need to succeed for the rest of my life.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Five Questions to Ask Yourself When Thinking About a Bootcamp to Transition Your Career\\nWhen I was researching ways to transition my career from education to the tech field, I wasn’t really sure about the questions I should be asking myself. It’s hard to know what you should be thinking about when it comes to doing something you’ve never done before; the more drastic the transition, the more difficult it is to know! For me, time was a deciding factor because I’m an adult with a family and all of the responsibilities that come along with that role. I knew I wanted a non-traditional path to my new career, and that’s how I found\\xa0Codeup, a career accelerator in Texas. A year and a half after I started researching my options, I’m a month away from completing Codeup’s Data Science program, and I have a much better idea of what you might want to think about if you’re starting to do your own research.\\nHere are five questions to ask yourself if you are thinking about a bootcamp to transition your career.\\n\\nWhat is my end goal?\\xa0If like me, you are looking to transition from one career to another, you should be comfortable with the idea that whether you are going into web development or data science, you will be starting out as a junior. I was in education for almost two decades, so when I left, I was at the top of my profession. It’s one thing to think about how exciting it will be to learn and do new things, but the reality can be more jarring than you think. Be prepared to struggle like you haven’t in many years and even fail sometimes. Keep your eyes on the prize, landing that first job in a new field, and cut yourself some slack as you struggle with new concepts and experiences. You didn’t start at the top in your last career, and this one will be no different.\\nHow stable is my personal life?\\xa0If you’re thinking about undertaking an intensive program to start the next chapter of your life, the last thing you need is to be distracted by a shaky personal life. You’re going to need some type of outside support, so you can focus all of your energy and attention on learning and practicing new skills. The cool thing about an intensive program like a bootcamp is that you are done in a fraction of the time it takes to finish a traditional degree. You will often have to sacrifice your nights and weekends, though, and that can be rough on your loved ones. Make sure to think and talk about those sacrifices before you commit to a program. Remember, it’s only for a short time!\\nHow much time do I need to prepare myself?\\xa0I took a full year to get my life in order before starting my twenty-week data science program, and that worked for me. That gave me time to complete my teaching contract, save a little money, and complete the intensive amount of pre-work I needed to do for my program. I know most of the students in my cohort did not need that much time to prepare, so the time you need will be entirely up to your unique situation. Be honest with yourself, and don’t let others make you feel rushed. This is a lifestyle change, so build a solid foundation for your future success.\\nAre my finances in order?\\xa0This one goes along with preparing yourself, but it’s important enough to deserve its own question. At Codeup, you are strongly encouraged not to work during your program, and there is good reason for that. For a short window, you are committing all of your resources to a goal, and most likely you will need most of your outside time to study and work on projects. This is a huge sacrifice for most independent adults, so make sure you are diligent when answering this question. There were a few people in my cohort who had no choice but to keep a part-time job on the side. Be realistic with yourself about how challenging this new field is going to be for you, about family responsibilities you may have, and plan accordingly for the months you will be without an income.\\nDo I have a Plan B?\\xa0You might expect me to tell you here that you should have a good, solid Plan B in place in case you bomb out of your program. Only you know what you really need to be successful, but I will tell you that I had no Plan B, and I used that to motivate me during the most challenging times of my program. There are going to be times when you feel like you emotionally and even physically can’t keep going in such an intensive program. If I had had an easier and acceptable backup plan, there are many times I may have been tempted to take that option. As I head into my capstone project, I’m so happy and proud that I kept pushing myself to meet the challenges I faced along this journey. You should decide before you start if a Plan B will help or hurt you. Personally, I gave myself no option but to succeed.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere are so many things to consider when planning a major transition in your life, but asking yourself these five questions is a good place to start. Your answers and your journey will be uniquely yours, so don’t be discouraged if they look different from other students in your chosen program. Even with the growing appreciation for diversity in our workplaces, it can be intimidating to pursue your passion if you have a non-traditional background; trust me, I know! All I can tell you is that there is room for passionate and committed people in every field, so do your research and go get your dream life.\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nWRITTEN BY\\n\\n\\n\\nFaith Kane\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducator, data scientist, barre junkie.

Alex shed some light on his Codeup and coding experience, and we’re sharing his story in hopes that it helps others take one step closer to landing the career of their dreams.\\xa0\\nLet’s start with you introducing yourself; where are you from, and what was your background before Codeup?\\n“My name is Alex, I’m not from San Antonio but have lived here on and off for most of my life. I have had a lot of random odd jobs before going to Codeup, everything from customer service, to logging, to a cruise ship deckhand, to bartender.”\\nWhat made you interested in coding? And what made you decide to pull the trigger and look for ways to make it your career?\\n“I was in Military Intelligence in the Army, and when I transitioned out, I decided to stay in intel and went to UTSA to get a CS degree to be in Cyber Security.”\\nHow did you end up coming to Codeup?\\n“I was bottlenecked in my degree plan (required to take a few prerequisite classes before I could proceed with my degree) at UTSA and decided that I didn’t want to spend another three semesters trying to get passed those classes. Codeup cut that time significantly for a very similar outcome at a cheaper price, so that’s what I chose.”\\nWhat has your experience been like here?\\n“Very challenging, but rewarding as well. My classmates were always there for each other when we needed help and generally went out of our way to help. That along with the enormous amount of knowledge made it a difficult but enjoyable experience.”\\nWhat would you tell people considering a career in software development?\\n“Practice. Without consistent practice, it is beyond difficult to learn and just as hard to retain. Keep programming even when you don’t need to. Learning doesn’t stop when class is over or when you’re graduated. You have to constantly stick with it.”\\xa0\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\xa0  Alex Ahrens is a software developer in San Antonio, TX.\\xa0\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\nAre you ready to explore the world of tech and the possibilities of a new career?

I was excited about the idea of returning to teaching, and reached out. We began talking, and I spent over a dozen hours getting to know their team, from management to instruction. During our conversations, I made up my mind: I wanted to work for Codeup. Here’s why!\\n\\xa0\\n#1: Codeup has a well-thought-out and high-quality curriculum. Not only that, but it teaches programming fundamentals. Some bootcamps teach programs that cover a dozen different technologies: React, Angular, Node, Ruby, Rails, Mongo DB, MySQL, Python, etc. As a developer, I can tell you: that’s crazy. Instead of a list of keywords, I discovered Codeup teaches a narrow scope of technologies with a focus on teaching students how to learn software development, giving them the power to go learn whatever technologies they want.\\n\\xa0\\n#2: Codeup promises, and follows through, to refund 100% of a student’s tuition if they don’t find a job after graduation. A lot of places say, ‘Hey come on over, we’ll help!’ I knew Codeup was for real and not just a money grab when they told me: “if a student does everything they’re supposed to and doesn’t find a job, that’s on us, not them.”\\n\\xa0\\n#3: Codeup has an impressive network of employer partners. They place graduates at companies like USAA, Accenture, Oracle, SWBC, and other large companies with a reputation. Having worked at a bootcamp, I know exactly how hard it is to get a company like USAA to consider bootcamp grads. That upped their cred in my book WAY high.\\n\\xa0\\n#4: Codeup accepts the GI Bill. In my eyes, the government legitimized them with their stamp of approval.\\n\\xa0\\nLastly, and most importantly, Codeup helped me realize my passion for helping bring other people into this amazing field. I’m so excited that I get to teach at Codeup, and help so many find a career they love. If you want to learn to code or start a new career, reach out to us – we’d love for you to decide to learn at Codeup.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'By\\xa0Kevin Cummings,\\xa0\\xa0NTX Inno Staff Writer (Dallas Business Journal)\\n—\\nStarted in 2013, San Antonio-based Codeup has been making a name for itself and helping bolster Texas’ tech and startup scene by training the next group of software developers. Now, after honing its curriculum and strengthening its ties across the state, Codeup is ready to open its second campus in Dallas.\\nNear the end of November, with the greenlight from the Texas Workforce Commission, the company began accepting applications for its first North Texas cohort that will begin in downtown Dallas in early 2020. It plans to have about 3 cohorts go through its 20-week program, graduating between 50 to 75 people next year.\\n“It seems to make good sense that we should be here; the number of jobs is more than the number of people that can do them and that’s what makes it such a great opportunity right now,”\\xa0Jason Straughan, CEO and co-founder of Codeup, told NTX Inno. “We want to make sure that we are getting the people that come through our classes jobs, we want our Dallas cohorts to have the same or better employment rates than they do in San Antonio.”\\nWhat started in the corner of a coworking space in San Antonio, with people walking in and out of the space while trying to teach the class, has quickly become a well-recognized organizations for helping people transition into coding and data careers. It started with a problem Straughan and his fellow co-founders noticed in the industry. Applicants would come in for interviews at their respective companies with a wealth of knowledge about theory, but when it came to practicality and implementation, they seemed to be lacking.\\n“We were talking about how college is teaching people to be computer scientists like you would teach an astronomer how a telescope works,” Straughan said.\\nSo Codeup was launched with a simple premise – teach software development like you would teach a skilled trade, with immersive learning. Over the course of the company’s 20-week program, students start coding on day one. The classes go from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by the end of it, students log about 630 classroom hours of direct experience.\\n“It’s day one you start writing code,” Straughan said. “How do you learn German? You speak it. How do you learn to code? It’s fingers on keyboards, and so that’s what we do.”\\nCodeup distinguishes itself from the numerous other similar programs out there in that it is outcome-driven, rather than profit-motivated. The co-founders of the organization are all involved in the tech industry outside of Codeup, allowing them to focus more on the curriculum than a business plan. Straughan said that in the beginning, instead of thinking about what students want to learn, Codeup went directly to the companies that would be hiring graduates and asked what skills were needed.\\nThis has given Codeup a high job placement rate for its graduates, with more than 98 percent of alumni finding jobs in the industry. Codeup stands by its program, offering graduates a complete refund if they are unable to find a software-related job within six months.\\n“Now that we are growing, we’re trying to do it slow to make sure that we maintain that kind of quality on the output, because we think that’s the long-term goal,” Straughan said. “We think it’s actually the most responsible way to deliver and education product.”\\nStraughan credits Codeup’s 28-member team with the success of the company. The connections made from previous graduates has, in part, driven Codeup’s expansion to Dallas. In the past year, the organization has placed 17 graduates in the North Texas area with large companies like USAA and Cognizant. In addition, he said that the growth of the tech industry in the region has made it attractive not only for its relatively high tech salaries, but also because of the number of job openings.\\nWhen it opens next year in Dallas, Codeup will also focus on helping drive diversity and inclusion in the local tech workforce. The company strives to have cohorts that represent the larger demographics of the region. It also offers scholarships for disadvantaged and minority residents looking to apply. Straughan said that it is something the tech industry should be talking about more, because the software that is being developed is used by all types of people, and those people should be represented at the development of the software as well.\\n“I think one of the other things we really enjoy about Codeup is when I entered software development, almost everybody in that career looked like me – they were all white dudes that liked to play with computers… the industry is changing and it is becoming more diverse, and I think we have an opportunity to help kickstart that and speed up that process,” he said. “I realized that the impact we are making is really a cool experience, it’s moving to me, it really is a purpose.”'},\n",

       "  'content': 'By Jesse Ruiz\\n\\n\\nBootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend.\\nMy first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in.\\nSecondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don’t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don’t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there.\\nWarning!—only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later.\\nLastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don’t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don’t pay anything until you get your first job.\\nAs for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist.\\nI will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding.\\nAll in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.\\nIf you need any advice, please feel free to contact me directly.

       "  'content': 'After the graduation of our first Codeup Data Science cohort, one company was eagerly waiting in the wings to scoop up a lot of our new grads: Quickpath. In business since 2004, Quickpath has helped deliver amazing customer experiences and optimize business decisions in over a hundred implementations for Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000 companies. But as the demand for their services increased—more than doubling each of the past three years—Quickpath found itself in a talent shortage.\\xa0\\n“We found ourselves leaving business on the table where customers were asking us for additional resources,” Alex Fly, CEO of Quickpath and board member of the Codeup Data Science program, said, “and we weren’t able to fill that request.”\\nFortunately, the Codeup Data Science curriculum was able to provide a much-needed pipeline of highly skilled individuals. Over the course of an intense 20-week, hands-on program, students learn a variety of data science tools and skills, including statistics, SQL, Python and regression analysis. This intense preparation, culminating in mastery with a capstone project, is what led Fly to hire not one, but three of our Codeup grads from the inaugural Data Science cohort.\\nCodeup Data Science Grads Making an Immediate Impact\\nQuickpath is a company that plays data science as a team sport—they really help their clients with all operations around data rather than simply creating a model. This means that Quickpath helps their clients in all the following areas:\\xa0\\n\\nBuilding the data pipeline—they first assist clients in gathering and wrangling their corporate data from disparate sources.\\nCleaning the data—after the data sources are identified, it’s important to ensure the data is clean and provides the right information for the model.\\nCreating the data model—after accumulating all that information, it’s time for the data scientist to put it to use, building a model that will help inform decisions.\\nMonitoring and managing the model’s outputs—once the data model is integrated into production, it needs to be validated to ensure it’s performing correctly, and the insights must be clearly understood by those consuming them.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nQuickpath hired the three Codeup grads as data and machine learning (ML) engineers to work on tasks that come both before and after data model creation. And while you may think of a data science professional as being tucked away in a room doing analysis, this role at Quickpath is very customer-facing, and within a week of being hired, the Codeup grads were already interacting with a number of Quickpath customers.\\nWhile such a short runway to customer interaction may evoke some nervousness in a new college graduate, the new Codeup hires were able to tap into their previous professional experience and jump right in.\\nLeveraging Previous Experiences for a Data Science Role\\nFly credits the immediate success of the new Codeup grads to their previous professional experience. While they may not have been in a data science role, these Codeup hires had worked in a corporate environment for years, often using data and analytic skills.\\xa0\\nOne individual, in particular, had been on the receiving end of information from a data science model. In their previous position as an analyst in fraud detection, they would receive data model outputs in order to assess whether transactions were fraudulent.\\xa0\\nAfter completing the Codeup Data Science program, this person now sits on the other side of the fence and has the ability to wrangle the data, develop a model and evaluate its success. His professional experience is what sets him apart: he keenly understands how front-line employees will interact with the data that he provides. Fly believes it’s this kind of professional experience that empowers Codeup graduates to hit the ground running.\\xa0\\nBut there’s something more than just previous professional experience. It’s also the sense that Codeup graduates are intrinsically motivated to make a major career change. As our first 2019 Data Science outcomes report noted, 77% of the class had a bachelor’s degree or higher. A person looking to change careers who invests in a 20-week program shows not only moxie but also curiosity.\\xa0\\n“Data science is constantly moving and evolving at a very high pace. There’s a new library, modeling or deep learning framework coming out literally every week—you’ve got to constantly stay on top of your game,” Fly explained. “So being able to identify folks who are lifelong learners has been a critical success factor for our hiring profile. We found a pretty high concentration of those folks at Codeup.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nLooking Forward: Advice for Future Codeup Data Science Students\\nThe demand for professionals with knowledge of data science is not going away anytime soon. Business is continuing to boom for Fly and Quickpath, and he is already looking forward to the next round of graduates. And for those looking to enroll in a future Codeup Data Science boot camp, he has two pieces of advice.\\nFirst, Fly emphasizes the importance of data, data, data, underscoring that it’s more important than all the algorithms of the world. He believes data preparation is the most fundamental skill to master.\\xa0\\n“An average data scientist with really good data will always be able to build a better model than an expert data scientist with data,” Fly stressed.\\nSecond, he advises that in order to be successful in this field, a person must have a love of learning and can never rest on their laurels.\\n“If you sit still for six months, your skills are out of date,” he advised. “You must have a thirst for knowledge and an ‘always-on’ learning mentality.”\\n\\xa0\\nAre you looking to reboot your career and become a data scientist or computer programmer? Then it’s time for you to look into Codeup. Our 20-week boot camps will immerse you in the latest technologies and provide you with the skills to make an immediate impact. We offer many financial aid options to help get you on your journey today.\\nPhoto provided by Startups San Antonio'},\n",

Now, we’re excited to bring our mission of creating pathways to Software Development and Data Science careers to more people. Dallas, we have our eyes set on you!\\nAfter five years exclusively focused on San Antonio, why expand now? As the bootcamp model has grown, we’ve watched our competitors expand nationally, open dozens of campuses, buy and sell to and from each other, launch coworking spaces, and more. Meanwhile, we believe the outcomes of our graduates far outweigh the number of campuses we have. We have refined our curriculum, built our team, expanded our partnership network, and built a brand people can trust. Where did we all end up? Many of our competitors have closed or sold. We’re still Texas-based, owned by our founders, and our investment in quality has brought our graduate placement rate to 97% over the last 18 months. So what’s next?\\nWith our product refined, we were ready to expand. We looked at cities all over the country, but quickly realized we didn’t want a second Codeup, or a third. Instead, we need additional campuses to belong to one cohesive Codeup. So we didn’t pick a city, we picked a state.\\xa0\\nTexas has the 10th largest economy in the world and has over 50 company headquarters from the Fortune 500 list. All four of our major cities (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio) have high demand for tech talent, offer a welcoming place to live and do business, and are home to a large veteran population ready for the jobs of tomorrow. We are not creating a second Codeup, but we are opening another campus. The time is right, and Texas is ready.\\xa0\\nDallas jumped to the top of our list to start with because we’ve already placed our graduates there at companies like USAA and Cognizant for average starting salaries of $86,666. We focus on job outcomes, so we go where our partnerships lead. That way, we can live our mission of empowering life change and launching careers in technology.\\nWe’ve secured a space in the heart of downtown Dallas, where students will have access to vibrant city life and dozens of employers. While we await final state approval for an early program 2020 launch, join our mailing list to be the first to hear when we launch!'},\n",

       "  'content': 'For some, it may be difficult to grasp how prevalent data science is in our world! We’ve written a post here that brings to life some of the ways in which you may see data science in your everyday routine. However, you may find yourself wondering exactly how far-reaching data science actually is, or how it actually impacts certain industries or companies. In this post, I’ll go a little deeper into these topics.\\nFor one, data science has been a major player in industries like manufacturing and retail. For example, in manufacturing, data science is utilized from an insight-driven perspective. Simply put, it’s how businesses use data to figure out how to best utilize their resources when making and producing a large-scale product they’re trying to sell to customers. For instance, a business may collect data on how the customer interacts with the product in order to figure out what features are most profitable to produce. They may also collect data related to how well the machinery is operating on the production line so they can analyze weak points and optimize efficiency. For example, Ford utilizes wireless connections and in-vehicle sensors to capture insights on driver behavior as well as ways to increase production speed.\\n\\nIn retail, we also see a similar move towards an insight-driven perspective, one that allows businesses to use predictive analytics by utilizing data from product reviews, call center records, and social media streams. On a merchandising front, businesses like Target and Walmart may even utilize data collected from video footage or track heat signatures in order to improve layout and product placements. If you have ever wondered why you can’t walk out of Target without spending at least a hundred bucks, now you know why! Basic industrial-organizational psychology usually places the most utilized items, like milk and eggs, in a place further into the store so that customers must walk past a plethora of products that they don’t need but may end up buying due to product placement. \\n\\nWhat has become even more significant than brick-and-mortar stores, however, are online retailers, such as Amazon. Because of the huge variety of items to choose from, many customers may feel overwhelmed by how many options there are when they visit the website. However, because Amazon is so great at collecting data on customers and then turning that raw data into valuable predictors, they make it much easier for the average consumer to buy products suited for them. For example, to figure out what items to recommend users, they collect data on what items that user browses through and what they end up buying. Amazon also takes into account the user’s shipping address, which lets them reliably predict what income a user may have. \\n\\nAll these little tidbits of information allow them to build a 360-degree model of who this individual so that they can associate them with a group of people that also have the same identifiers. Grouping users can help Amazon make assumptions about what you will buy based on what others buy in your grouping. If you buy Burt’s Bees Lip Balm with a predicted income of 53k, they may come to the conclusion that people in this category also have a high rate of buying Bounty Quick-Size Paper Towels, which they can then recommend you buy next. In many ways, it’s exactly like what Target does with product placement when someone walks into the store. However, because Amazon lacks a physical storefront they must instead strategically place products around the web page in order to create the same passerby effect. \\xa0\\n\\nOn a larger scale, this is essentially how advertising works on all the social media platforms you may find yourself scrolling through. One one hand, they may collect data on you in order to predict which advertisements your group of users may relate with. However, they may also track your individual data and essentially stalk you with little bits of code called cookies. For example, one time while scrolling through Instagram, I saw an ad for my absolute favorite chai brand that’s manufactured in the town of my alma mater, the University of Colorado at Boulder. I caught myself thinking, “ How in the world did they know?” The ad was so specific to my preferences that it caught me off guard. I’m assuming at some point I had Googled this brand of chai and the browser cookies were used by Instagram to target users with that specific interest, which is in general how most targeted advertising works. The weird part is, I couldn’t recall ever Googling it… \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is, many businesses are collecting data on behaviors you may not even realize. Some say that Facebook records users through their phones or that Alexa is listening to you without your knowledge. The truth is, we have reached an age in which data is a highly valued commodity. As demonstrated by the near failure of footwear company Timberland, how a company uses data can either make or break them. As data becomes increasingly important in our world, the demand for data scientists will be even higher. \\xa0\\nIf you’re interested in becoming a data scientist, check out Codeup’s program here. It’s a 22-week hands-on accelerator that will teach you all the technical skills you need to know in order to jumpstart a career in Data Science.\\n\\xa0\\n—\\n\\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

That’s why this week we are excited to highlight one of our long-standing financial aid partners –\\xa0Project QUEST\\xa0– to show you how many pathways are available.\\nFirst of all, we view your tuition as an investment in your future, and we put our best people, ideas, and efforts to make that investment fruitful. But we also want to make that investment more accessible by providing as many financial pathways as possible for tuition funding. As we approach their annual fundraising luncheon this week, we want to highlight Project QUEST as one of the most effective such pathways you can explore.\\n“The experience of attending Codeup has radically altered my life. Now, instead of financially treading water in a service industry job with a college degree that felt wasted, I have a fulfilling professional career with exciting possibilities for in-field advancement.” – Madeleine Capper\\nProject QUEST is a San Antonio based non-profit dedicated to workforce development and building our city’s future economy. They provide grant funding for educational and training programs, as well as career coaching and support resources (like utilities, childcare, and transportation). Over the last 4 years, Project QUEST and Codeup have collaborated to help dozens of students change careers.\\n“Assistance from Project QUEST was invaluable and empowering.\\xa0They offer incredible support for career training.” – Jesse Ruiz\\nIn 2019 alone, Project QUEST has helped Codeup train 23 Software Developers and Data Scientists.

       "  'content': 'When I was 17 years old an Army recruiter came along and convinced me that the military was a good choice and could afford me many great opportunities in life. At the time I was living a carefree life with a close friend. I hadn’t considered what the next year of my life would look like, let alone the next decade. I didn’t really see myself as a soldier, but I was strongly encouraged to enlist and so I did.\\xa0\\nTo be honest, the next four years were pretty miserable for me. I hated getting up at six every morning to be on time for Physical Training. I resisted the formal structure of everything, from marching in formation to folding my socks a certain way.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe abrupt change to the way I had existed before the military resulted in what felt like a state of shock that lasted for four years. Finally, the time came and I was discharged. I was free to do whatever I wanted to do, and for the first time in life I realized that I had choices to make that would shape my future.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe military would pay for me to attend college as well as my living expenses. The only problem was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do and it took me years to figure it out.\\xa0\\nI spent the next few years between college courses, working overseas as a contractor, frequently switching my degree plan to follow my latest interests whether that was graphic design or culinary school.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nA decade later I found myself\\xa0making just enough money to pay bills.\\xa0It felt like what I imagined a rat race must feel like – stuck and going nowhere fast.\\xa0\\n\\nIt was during this time that I began playing around with building websites. I was far from good at it, but I enjoyed it, a lot.\\nIn April of 2018 I found out about coding bootcamps. I had never considered that I could make a living as a web developer. I didn’t even know what a web developer did. But it turns out that developers do the things that I enjoyed so much that I stayed up all night doing them.\\xa0\\nAt the time I was managing a small cafe, making $11 an hour. I was also a part-time uber driver to help make ends meet. It sucked, big time.\\n\\xa0It was at this time that I made the best decision I’ve ever made. I quit that job and decided to focus on teaching myself how to code while I researched coding bootcamps that would allow me to use the remaining months I had left of my GI-Bill.\\xa0\\nIt was important to me that the school be reputable, care about their students and have a solid track record of getting students a job.\\xa0\\nCodeup met all those requirements.\\nBefore attending Codeup, I decided that if I was going to risk the time and money it would require to improve my life and take a chance on something I knew I truly enjoyed I’d have to do some things differently. I was going to have to give it 110% because if I failed at this I didn’t want there to be any possibility that it was because I held anything back.\\nI like to think that my military training kicked into overdrive.\\nWhile at bootcamp, I arrived hours early, sometimes turning on the lights myself. Many evenings I stayed late to study and work on projects. I took pride in everything I did, making each and every project better than the last and paying attention to the details. I stayed positive, took care of myself and made coding my life. I hardly watched any television at all, one of my favorite pastimes. I also developed some amazing friendships. I continuously modified my time and intentions at Codeup to shape the best outcome possible.\\nNeedless to say, this time around I was ready for it and bootcamp was one of the best experiences of my life.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCurrently I work for Cognizant. It’s the best job I’ve ever had. It feels just like Codeup where I was constantly learning and loving every second of it. I work with all the friends I made at Codeup and the salary is… well, like everything else, a dream come true.\\nThere’s absolutely nothing I would change about my experiences -Army bootcamp or coding bootcamp. I know without a doubt that because I attended both, I’m living my best life!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Dorian Wallace is a software engineer at Cognizant in Dallas, TX.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Just a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: “Try replacing ‘should’ with ‘want’ and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your ‘should’ and your ‘want’ are aligned.” Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn’t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn’t completely sure about?\\nWith this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I’m not really a super logical person… Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses… and finally landing a dream job?! It’s a colorful blur.\\nSo that’s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.\\n1. “I’m not cut out for a career in tech”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn’t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I’m in over my head and that I don’t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I’m already doing it. The truth is, it isn’t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn’t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to.\\n2. “I wouldn’t fit in with engineers”\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves “I’m just going to be a barista forever, because that’s who I am” or “My personality only suits being in a teacher, so I’m not going to try something different.” The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there’s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career.\\n3. “I don’t want to work alone all day staring at a computer screen”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are days where indeed this is the case for me, just “heads down coding”, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don’t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we’re not stepping on each other’s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I’m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don’t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.\\n4. “I don’t have enough experience”\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They’re only a few keystrokes away. \\nOne thing to note about the technology field is that it’s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education.\\n5. “I’m not tech savvy enough.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough basic computer skills are necessary for success, it’s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you’re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can’t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to – all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I’ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned.\\n\\nAs you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don’t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don’t have to define your journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/data-science/everyday-encounters-with-data-science/',\n",
       "  'content': 'You come home from work, tired to the bone and groaning as you realize you forgot to prep dinner tonight. So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google “restaurants near me”. You scroll down the list of places to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the ratings are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it’s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it’s open… the list goes on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hours have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurants around you are closed… and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. \\nA week later, life finds you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there’s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!\\n\\nThis very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let’s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data. \\n\\xa0\\nHow Google Does It\\nBefore we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.\\n\\nA simple action such as filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment.\\n\\xa0\\nGoogle Maps, A Man’s Best Friend\\nAnother important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. \\nSo how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of shows that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. \\nSimilarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.\\n\\n\\nWhen Robots Take Over the World\\nAs the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

       "  'content': 'By Joyce Ling\\nFor many people, January is a time for new beginnings. People commit to losing weight, learning new things, establishing new budgets – it’s a time of action and hope. In this article, I’d like to share a few ways that have helped me improve my coding and might give you some ideas to implement for 2019!\\n1. Kickstart with a 30-day challenge. \\n“Good seasons start with good beginnings.” – Sparky Anderson\\nWhy do a 30-day challenge?\\nAlthough the process of learning coding is a marathon and not a sprint, there’s something to be said for short bursts of productivity like a 30-day challenge. For one, it may be an effective way to just get started on something you have been meaning to do for awhile, and as Mark Twain noted, “Half of getting ahead is getting started.”\\nOn top of that, it gets rid of any excuses about “not having enough time”. Because it’s a short sprint, most people will begin prioritizing it differently. As different items on your daily to-do list begin to demand your time, you begin to prioritize the things that matter. Especially if you are a goal-oriented person, the satisfaction of completing a challenge like this may force you to prioritize it over other things. This may be the impetus you need to create lasting habits, ideally even after the challenge is over. However, over-enthusiastic participants may have to be wary of burnout or of a short-term “high”. Make sure to use that momentum and keep on keeping on!\\n3 Challenges to Try\\nIf you Google “coding 30-day challenge”, a multitude of options pop up. These challenges hypothetically can be done at any time, but doing it in January can be a powerful experience as you make a commitment to investing in yourself in 2019. Some popular coding challenges include the #Javascript30 by developer Wes Bos, the 30 day challenge at TechGig, and the 30 Days of Code by HackerRank. The first challenge is specific to Javascript, but the latter two challenges allow you to choose from a variety of languages to complete the challenges, so choose your best language and get coding!\\n2. Commit to coding every single day.\\n“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. – Dwayne Johnson\\nSlow and Steady\\nFor those of you that are over the 30-day challenge hype, simply commit to coding every single day of 2019. If you’re like me and have a bunch of grandiose life goals for yourself such as “Speak French fluently” and “Be able to program any full stack application”, you may also have to be reminded that these grandiose goals can only be reached by consistently chipping away at it on a daily basis. It requires you to embrace mundanity and discipline.\\nSet Yourself Up For Success\\nA neat life hack for making this goal a reality is finding a habit tracker such as HabitBull or Habitica. Both of these apps allow you to customize habits that you would like to form and track how often you complete those habits. Habitbull generates statistics and graphs for the frequency of completing certain habits, while Habitica promises to “gamify your life”. Although this option may no longer be available for purchase, take a look at Simone Giertz’s Kickstarter for a 365 calendar here. This is a visual example of what completing a full year’s worth of coding can look like.\\nIf you dedicate yourself to coding every single day, you may be surprised at how much progress you’ve made by the end of the year. Even extremely successful individuals such as Josh Bosquez, the Senior Vice President of Engineering at my company, Armor, has shared that he still commits to coding every single day even if it’s only one line. No matter what your coding experience level is, making it a priority to code every single day can only benefit your growth as a programmer. \\n3. Learn a new technology.\\nNo matter what, you’ve got to always follow your passion in life and always keep learning. – Harold Hamm\\nTechnology is developing rapidly, and developers are constantly enhancing and creating frameworks and programming languages. For example, if you’re even slightly involved in the coding community, you would probably know that for front-end frameworks, React and Vue have recently exploded in popularity. In order to stay relevant and continue to develop marketable skills, make an effort to stay up to date about news and trends in the programming world and keeping your skills sharp. \\nWhat To Learn Next\\nIf you’re just starting out with programming and feel that you have reached a plateau, many more experienced developers will recommend learning a second programming language to reiterate what you know and simultaneously enhance your understanding of programming on a deeper level.\\nHowever, learning a new technology includes more than just learning a new programming language or framework. Explore what’s interesting to you. Have you always wanted to look into artificial intelligence and machine learning? Or are you interested in the cloud and learning AWS? Or maybe you’ve always wanted to learn more about developing mobile applications. \\nCommit to an actionable goal by either taking a course for a specific technology you want to learn or by studying and passing a certification. If you work for a company, it may be worth it to see if your manager agrees to help pay for additional learning or certifications. \\n4. Build a project from scratch.\\nThe best way to learn is by doing. The only way to build a strong work ethic is getting your hands dirty. – Alex Spanos\\nIf you’ve decided you want to learn a new technology, the above quote by Alex Spanos is the perfect way to gain that proficiency. This can be done on your own or with a group of friends for accountability. One specific resource I always like to recommend is Chingu. This international group of developers goes through “Voyages”, a process which encompasses project planning, developing, testing, and launching an application, specifically with the end goal of learning or practicing a new technology. Many of the participants are full-time software developers, but the collection of individuals is usually diverse. This organization is mostly focused on front-end technologies but they also have data science/design tracks in development. Check out their website for examples of previous projects teams have built and details on how to apply. \\n5. Pass on what you know. \\nYou’re never too young or too old to be a mentor. – Reshma Saujani\\nEven if you are just starting out, there are usually local organizations that need volunteers to mentor/facilitate learning for youth. In San Antonio I was hired part-time by Youth Code Jam, a non-profit that organizes and plans pop-up events and hosts summer camps in order to educate youth in topics related to technology. Currently, in Dallas, I volunteer with Bold Idea, a local organization that teaches kids to code, as well as facilitate a Girls Who Code group at a local library. \\nBenefits of Mentoring\\nAlthough I don’t consider myself yet to be a very experienced developer, seeking these leadership roles is more than just a resume builder. Because I have participated in these opportunities, I’ve been able to expose myself to a wider variety of technologies such as block-level coding in Scratch, or creating Minecraft mods in Python. Additionally, it’s a great way to network and meet people who are also interested in or work in the the technology field. Most large cities have similar local nonprofits or a chapter of a national organization such as Girls Who Code. If none exist, start one! \\n6. Find a community.\\nEvery successful individual knows that his or her achievement depends on a community of persons working together. – Paul Ryan\\nAlthough flying solo works for some, I have always found that having a tight knit community of motivated developers to consistently code with has always helped me grow. When I was participating in Codeup, some of us would form study groups or code together on projects after class at the local co-working space, Geekdom. \\nWhere to Look\\nAlthough the community that is available at a bootcamp is not available to everyone, I would recommend searching Meetup.com for technology networking groups or programming specific get-togethers. Alternatively, make sure to check for a local chapter of FreeCodeCamp in your city. Other places to look include maker spaces and co-working spaces, both of which are communities that developers are typically drawn towards. \\nIf both of those options come up empty, then start a group! Create a space for people to get together and work on their projects – invariably, you will draw like-minded people towards you.\\n[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]'},\n",

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/codeup-prepared-career/',\n",
       "  'content': 'By Joyce Yueh Yueh Ling\\nIn four months, a lot can change.\\xa0Four months: A San Antonio winter, a long distance relationship, a college semester. \\nDuring my four months at Codeup, I pursued what felt like an unattainable goal and actually reached it. When I tell people that I’ve been coding less than a year and am now working as a software developer, people are usually impressed. But to be frank, I could never have done that without attending a coding boot camp like Codeup. It was a short four-month process that was like stumbling from a dusty, old wardrobe into Narnia: on one side, a clumsy and unenlightened beginner and thereafter being transformed by a completely new and fantastical world. Attending Codeup armed me with the experience and knowledge that allowed me to survive the harsh winter landscape that starting out from scratch as a software developer can be. \\nNow as I am working at my first real job, I’m grateful to Codeup for teaching me several things that allowed me to be better prepared for my career.\\n1. Collaboration\\nPaired Programming\\nFrom beginning to end, Codeup placed a huge emphasis on group exercises. The beginning of the course was characterized by paired programming, a process in which one person is the navigator and one is the driver. As the names suggest, the navigator communicates with the person at the keyboard and directs them to type certain bits of code or navigate to specific elements on the page. Often, we would flip-flop between these roles so both students could get a crack at practicing one of two things: Firstly, we practiced how to communicate clearly and efficiently. Secondly, we learned how to take direction and ask clarifying questions. \\nAt the time, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was with paired programming and why the instructors at Codeup had made it such an integral part of the curriculum. However, as I go about my everyday duties at work, I realized how often I engage in informal bouts of paired programming. Although we have a Wikipedia-style knowledge base at my work where we document our processes, a lot of knowledge is still transferred orally (not ideal, but we’re working on it!). What this means is that paired programming happens on a daily basis. If a developer is having a complex problem, it is usually easier for a coworker who has solved this problem before to sit down and walk them through it rather than try to explain things via chat or email.\\nGroup Projects\\nTowards the end of the semester, we coalesced into group projects in which the primary focus was teamwork. This was where we got a taste of working independently but in a team effort. It was during the group projects that I discovered the importance of learning how to use a versioning control system, such as GitHub, that allowed multiple developers to participate on the same project without stepping on any toes. When I started my job at Armor, I realized how much more complex versioning control can get when you have potentially 50+ people contributing to the same repository at any given time. I had to relearn the fundamentals and be extra careful not to overwrite someone else’s work. Most mistakes are reversible, but the headache of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it is usually a source of distraction from a developer’s daily duties and sprint goals.\\n2. Learning how to ask for help\\nLike Real Life\\nWhen I initially started at Codeup, I found myself wanting to ask the instructors questions as soon as I got stuck on something. However, I quickly realized that their resources were limited since there were only 2 of them (plus 1-2 fellows) in a class of 30. Although this wasn’t ideal, it actually did simulate a real-life scenario that parallels a professional working environment. At my work, there are probably only 2 or 3 lead developers. However, \\xa0they are constantly inundated with requests by QE and other junior developers, code review, and demands from management. If you need to make a request, best make it quick and efficient. \\nAsking Questions the Right Way\\nI then remembered what instructors had mentioned during Codeup. They taught us that if you have a question, make sure you present it in a format such as:\\n\\n Describe your question/problem in detail.\\n What have you already done to try and solve it? \\n Why don’t you think your solution worked? \\n\\nThis made it so that students would actually try to figure out a solution before shooting their hand up every time they had a problem, only to find that they could have easily solved it with a little more digging. In my experience, most experienced developers are usually happy to help. However, it’s good practice to make sure to demonstrate you tried your best and that you’re not wasting their precious time. \\n3. Pushing through the doubt\\n“I’m not cut out for this”\\nThroughout the boot camp, it came to be a running joke that everyone would have an emotional breakdown at least once during their time at Codeup. You would see someone walk off and come back with teary, red eyes. Or for some, they would vocalize their despair: “I don’t think I’m cut out for this.”, “This is too hard.”, “I’m so frustrated!”, “Maybe I should just give up.” I myself broke down emotionally several times during Codeup and reiterated several mental self-doubts to myself: “Maybe I should have stuck to the arts. I’m too emotional to do well in computer science. I’ll never be good enough”. On some days, you would feel accomplished and confident in your abilities. On other days, the doubts would flood in unexpectedly and endanger everything I had worked so hard for. However, through the support of other students in the class, the instructors, and the encouragement of the staff, I was able to succeed throughout the course and completed my Demo Day project. \\nIt Always Gets Better\\nAll this is to say, Codeup taught me to have emotional fortitude and a confidence to believe in myself. Because to be honest, the first several months at my job also felt like an emotional roller coaster. I was thrown into an environment where I had to learn and adapt very quickly. \\xa0I was constantly afraid and timid because I was the only female developer and also the most junior developer. I expected a lot out of myself, and when I was given criticism I would internally berate myself until my negative self-talk had multiplied the original piece of criticism in my mind ten-fold of what it actually was.\\nHowever, my experience at Codeup had taught me to push through in those moments of self-doubt. It gave me a thicker skin in order to ask for help, to learn quickly amidst a ton of ambiguity, and most importantly, a realization that it will always get better as long as I don’t give up\\n4. Learning how to learn\\nAs you might have noticed, none of the points above are actually related to the technical knowledge I received by attending Codeup and how it affected my career. It goes without saying that Codeup provided me with the coding skills I needed to be succeed in my career. However, another point that our instructors emphasized was that Codeup was not a comprehensive coding academy or computer science degree. In some ways, it was like a tour bus that allowed you a brief overview of all the major stops in the area. \\nIt allowed us to have the impetus and catalytic energy to start off a software development career. It also gave us the tools to quickly be able to pick up any technologies our companies were using. \\n“We’re teaching you how to learn,” they would say throughout the course. After starting my first job, I came to realize how true this statement was. I imagined myself trying to pick up the technologies at my job without having Codeup as a primer and it seemed near impossible.\\n\\nNeedless to say, Codeup was an essential experience I needed on the way to becoming a full-time software developer. I learned critical skills that have proved invaluable in my day-to-day and have allowed me to be where I am today.\\n—\\n\\n\\xa0\\nJoyce is a full time software developer at Armor, a cloud security company in Richardson, TX.

       "  'content': 'By Amy Yanaway\\n\\xa0\\nAlmost every day since graduating from Codeup in December 2017, I have meditated over how much my life has changed in such a short period of time. Especially during this Thanksgiving season, I took the time to reflect even more deeply about the top three reasons I am grateful for Codeup. I am thankful for: \\n1. Codeup as a career accelerator\\nWhen they say that Codeup is a “career accelerator,” they are not joking! In just 18 weeks, you graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the industry as a junior developer. \\nWhen I was first searching for options to learn how to code, I was told that any college degree program would take me two to four full-time years, or four or more part-time years, to finish. As we all know, our bills do not get put on hold while we are in school! \\nI also looked into free or inexpensive part-time programs so that I could continue to work full-time, and although I would describe myself as diligent and able to handle self-study, this would also have been a long route, and without the career advice and connections Codeup provides. Knowing what I know now, I am so glad I didn’t try to study on my own. The depth of Codeup’s curriculum, compared to some online training I have tried, is unmatched and very important to have in my current work as a developer.\\nWhen you think about it, 18 weeks is a blip in your life, especially when that blip of time in Codeup very quickly produces a return on your investment. Remember to consider wages lost when making your decision: your time is VALUABLE, and time spent not in the workforce is wages lost that you could have been making. Speaking of finances, I am also thankful for…\\n2. Codeup’s financial aid offerings\\nDid you know that many students receive internal scholarships and financial help from Codeup’s funding partners? I, too, had sticker shock when I saw the price tag, but I ended up receiving Codeup’s Women in Tech scholarship, as well as a grant from Project Quest, which greatly reduced my cost. For the remaining balance, I utilized one of Codeup’s loan partners, which offers reduced payments while in school, and for two months after. Read more about my journey through Codeup here. Last but not least, I am thankful for…\\n3. Codeup opening the door to the tech industry for me\\nUntil just a few years ago, I had never in my life met a computer programmer. I was not aware that this was a thriving career, or that development and IT jobs occupy many of the slots on Glassdoor’s list of top careers. For several years, I was stuck in another field that was not for me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to get my foot in the door of this industry that seemed like it would better suit me and my needs. However, I did not have any connections in the industry or the direction needed to do this myself.\\nCodeup provided access to the tech field to me, as a woman who knew nothing about code prior to attending, and as someone who constantly doubted (and still do sometimes) whether I would be able to grasp what I had heard was very difficult subject matter. They saw potential in my aptitude and, more importantly, in my attitude. \\nLife since Codeup has been incredible. My job is fun, challenging, and stimulating; most of the time, it feels like I’m working on jigsaw puzzles all day. The hours just fly by, and I can’t believe I’m getting paid for this! Sometimes, when that pesky ol’ imposter syndrome pops up, a coworker of mine will brag about the quality or speed of my work to my supervisor, and I’ll feel validated and appreciated all over again, despite my newness to the field. Financially, I also feel appreciated, as I am now a skilled worker in high demand. In fact, in less than a year since graduating from Codeup, I was able to purchase my first home, all by myself!\\nThis truly has been a life changing year. Codeup got me in the door of the tech industry, and where I go from here is up to me. This Thanksgiving, I am humbly grateful for finally being able to carve out my place in the world, and I hope the same for you. Happy Thanksgiving, y’all!\\n—\\nAmy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger’s first ever online ordering platform. She has a Master’s degree in Music Theory and keeps that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute.

       "  'content': 'By Marcella Munter\\nI looked at Codeup for 2 years before I finally made the decision to apply. As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. \\nThe online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn’t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup’s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn’t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup’s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, “Will I get a job afterwards?”\\nI learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers’ requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup’s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn’t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I’m doing now. My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner.\\n[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Codeup welcomed the Wrangell cohort on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we launched a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We’ll interview a student over the course of their time with us to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the !\\nCheck out Month 1 and Month 2.\\n\\xa0\\nCodeup: How has your experience been at Codeup so far? \\nWrangell Student: I’ve had a great experience so far. Everything has been what I imagined and more. I have learned things in a short amount of time that otherwise would’ve taken me months upon months to learn. The people here are some of the kindest and most supportive people that I’ve met in a long time, and I’m happy to have this experience in my life. \\nC: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? \\nS: We’ve just started our capstone project which is the final hurrah of our Codeup experience. We are in the planning stages and it’s honestly a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information we’re communicating to our teammates and because of the volume of work that’s going to be done over this next week or two. Nonetheless, I am excited by the challenge and I know that our final project is going to be something that I will be really proud of and really happy to have been a part of. I’m excited to see how it will all pan out. \\nC: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\\nS: I love doing research and the focus of my research has shifted from solely academic to a balance between academic and professional. I am still researching new technologies as well as doing further research into the current curriculum but now I am also doing research into potential companies I’d like to work with. I’m interested in their mission and if their goals align with mine, both short and long term.\\nC:What has been the most memorable part of this month?\\nS:The most memorable part of this month has been actually shopping for new interview outfits, looking at myself in the mirror, and seeing a young professional. This has been one of my long-term goals and it’s a great experience seeing it come to fruition.\\nC:How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? \\nS: I think my skill levels are increasing each month. Now that we are going into full stack applications I can finally see the cumulative success of my time here.\\nC: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? Have you started working with the placement side of Codeup? If so, can you elaborate on that? \\nS: I am grateful for the mock interview process with the instructors. It’s really helpful to have your instructors grade you on your performance and prep you for real world interviews. These instructors all have some sort of practical experience and firsthand knowledge of the professional world. Their experience and advice is invaluable.\\nC: Did you learn anything new at Codeup that you weren’t expecting? \\nS: I wasn’t expecting to learn as many people skills as I did. I thought this was strictly a technical school and this really came as a surprise. I have really learned how to network and how to talk to people that I otherwise would have been scared to talk to. I’ve learned that people are people, just humans, and improving conversational skills to talk with them is valuable. Learning the value of a human connection in the professional world is a very exciting thing.\\nC: Have you been interviewing for jobs? What has that been like? If not, do you know what type of role you are looking for? (Ie. Developer, Q/A, Tech sales, Tech Ed, etc)\\nS: I’ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. Having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. It’s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. Time management is another big challenge. How much time do I put into studying versus interview prep? How much time can I dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? These challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help.\\nC: If you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be? \\nS: Really do your research. Know what you’re getting into. You can’t go into anything blind! Get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. A great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run.'},\n",

       "  'url': 'https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-cooking-steaks-to-cooking-code/',\n",
       "  'content': 'by Alexander Bous\\n\\nGrowing up\\nIt would be an understatement to say that the bar of expectations were set high as the youngest of 4 to immigrant parents, who were also mechanical engineers. Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn’t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings.\\nCooking\\nAt the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. “What?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.” Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what’s best for my family, and transition careers.\\nThe Most Important Thing\\nEarly on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: “The most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.” This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don’t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? “A happy family and nothing else” is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it’s time to figure out how to get there.\\nThe First Step: Codeup Open House\\nAfter spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.\\nThe Second Step: “Good”\\nAfter getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move. \\xa0I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. “What a relief,” I thought. It was good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn’t do it. \\nFinding a Job with Only Cooking Experience\\nAfter graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.\\nGoal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain Skills\\nI got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.\\n[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]'}]"
